Description: "Shapeshift at Will:As an action, you may transform into any creature or plant you have seen before. This functions similarly to True Polymorph with the following differences:    ◦ Duration: Indefinite (until you drop the form, die, or dismiss it as a bonus action)    ◦ No CR limitation    ◦ You do not gain spellcasting or legendary/lair actions    ◦ You gain natural traits such as wings for flight, burrowing, darkvision, and climbing/swimming speeds    ◦ You retain your mental stats (Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma)Plant Form:You can transform into a non-creature plant (e.g., tree, vine, flower) for perfect stationary camouflage.    ◦ While in plant form, you cannot move or take actions other than ending the form.    ◦ You gain advantage on Stealth checks while motionless.Mimicry Expertise:You have advantage on Deception and Performance checks when impersonating a person or species. Creatures must succeed on a DC 18 Insight check to suspect something is wrong with your form.Limitations• No Combat Power Gain: You do not gain class features, resistances, or actions beyond what is inherent to the natural creature’s body (e.g., a bird's flight, a cat's claws). You may attack, but cannot cast spells unless the form is humanoid and your class allows it.• Vulnerable While Plant: You are incapacitated while in plant form. You cannot sense your surroundings beyond passive perception, and do not automatically revert unless damaged or you dismiss the form.• Magic Detection: Creatures with true seeing, or divine sense may detect something unnatural about your presence"
