Description: "HoplonShield Block:When hit by a melee attack, use your reaction to reduce the damage by 2d8 + Strength modifier.Punishing Guard:If you reduce the damage to 0, the attacker has disadvantage on all melee attacks against you until the end of their next turn.Stagger: If you reduce the damage to 0 and the attacker is Large or smaller, they must make a DC 16 Strength saving throw or be pushed 5 feet and knocked prone.SarissaMultiplication (X/long Rest | X is your proficiency bonus):Choose up to 2 other creatures within 10 feet of your target. Each must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC 17) or take 5d8 piercing damage.These spectral sarissas ignore cover and reactions. If only one creature is within range, both spears may target it.Pezhetairoi Syntagma x100 (1/Long Rest):As an action, summon 100 spears to strike in a 10-ft cube within 60 feet. All creatures in the area must make a DC 18 Dexterity saving throw.• On a failed save: take 8d8 piercing damage and are knocked prone.• On a success (the target of the attack):    • Declare a weapon-based or martial technique-based attack (DM discretion).    • Roll an attack roll with that weapon or technique.    • If the attack hits AC 16 or higher, the creature reduces the damage it would take by the result of that attack’s damage roll (no bonus actions or extra effects apply — just base damage).This technique ignores resistance and immunity to nonmagical piercing damage and destroys all mundane structures in the area. Creatures behind total cover still take half damage as phantom spears phase through obstructions."
