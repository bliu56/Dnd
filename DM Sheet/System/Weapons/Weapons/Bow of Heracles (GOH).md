Description: "Mythic Penetration:Attacks with the Bow of Heracles ignore resistance to nonmagical, magical, and even force damage. It pierces through cover, including Wall of Force, and any barrier with an AC below 25.Overpenetration:When you hit a creature with this bow, you may choose to continue the arrow's path in a straight line up to its maximum range. Make a new attack roll against each creature or object in that line, subtracting 2 from the roll for each target it has already hit. Each creature takes full damage on a hit.Hydra's Blood Coating: On a hit, the target must make a DC 19 Constitution saving throw or suffer the following:     • Take 4d6 poison damage at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute.     • Gain 1 level of exhaustion at the start of each of its turns if they fail the save on consecutive turns (max 3).     • A creature that dies while poisoned this way rises as a poisoned, maddened specter for 1 hour under the DM’s control.Addictive Wound: Targets who fail the Hydra's Blood save must make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw at the end of combat. On a fail, they become psychologically addicted to the bow’s poison (DM’s discretion; may be flavored as withdrawal-like effects or craving further exposure).True Arrow of Heracles (1/Long Rest):You may declare a single attack to be the True Arrow. After firing, your strength will drop to [0 + your level] until your next long rest. This arrow:     • Deals: 4d10 piercing +6d6 poison damage.     • Ignores all immunities and resistances.     • On a hit, the target must succeed a DC 21 Strength saving throw or be pinned to the terrain (if possible) and be restrained.     • Leaves a glowing scar visible only to gods, celestials, or those bearing curses."
