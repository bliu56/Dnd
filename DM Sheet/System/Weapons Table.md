|[[Bow of Heracles (GOH)]]|A|Bow, Longbow, Myth|requires attunement by a creature with STR 18+ and courage tested through heroic trial|**Weapon Type:** Longbow**Attack Bonus: +3** to hit and damage rolls _(counts as a +3 magical weapon)_  <br>**Range:** 150/600 feet**Damage:** `2d10` `**+ Strength or Dexterity modifier + 3**` `piercing, plus 2d6 poison`**Properties:** Heavy, Two-Handed, Ammunition|**Mythic Penetration:**  <br>Attacks with the Bow of Heracles ignore resistance to nonmagical, magical, and even force damage. It pierces through cover, including _Wall of Force_, and any barrier with an AC below 25.  <br>**Overpenetration:**  <br>When you hit a creature with this bow, you may choose to continue the arrow's path in a straight line up to its maximum range. Make a new attack roll against each creature or object in that line, subtracting 2 from the roll for each target it has already hit. Each creature takes full damage on a hit.  <br>**Hydra's Blood Coating:**  <br>On a hit, the target must make a **DC 19 Constitution saving throw** or suffer the following:  <br>• Take `**4d6 poison damage**` at the start of each of its turns for 1 minute.  <br>• Gain **1 level of exhaustion** at the start of each of its turns if they fail the save on consecutive turns (max 3).  <br>• A creature that dies while poisoned this way rises as a poisoned, maddened specter for 1 hour under the DM’s control.  <br>**Addictive Wound:**  <br>Targets who fail the Hydra's Blood save must make a **DC 17 Wisdom saving throw** at the end of combat. On a fail, they become **psychologically addicted** to the bow’s poison (DM’s discretion; may be flavored as withdrawal-like effects or craving further exposure).  <br>**True Arrow of Heracles (1/Long Rest):**  <br>You may declare a single attack to be the _True Arrow_. After firing, your strength will drop to [0 + your level] until your next long rest. This arrow:  <br>• Deals: `4``**d10 piercing +6d6 poison damage**``.`  <br>• Ignores all immunities and resistances.  <br>• On a hit, the target must succeed a **DC 21 Strength saving throw** or be pinned to the terrain (if possible) and be **restrained**.  <br>• Leaves a glowing scar visible only to gods, celestials, or those bearing curses.|![[Bow_of_Heracles.PNG.webp]]|[https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Bow_of_Heracles](https://godofhighschool.fandom.com/wiki/Bow_of_Heracles)|God of Highschool|Greek, Heracles, National Treasure, Poison, Semi-Sentient|
