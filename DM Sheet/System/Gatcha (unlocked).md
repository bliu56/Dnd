## Probabilities

|k|P_hit(k) (exact)|P_hit(k) %|P_pick(k) %|P_glimpse_lock(k) %|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|2|1 / 924|0.1082%|2.38095%|0.21916%|
|3|1 / 308|0.32468%|4.76190%|0.49556%|
|4|1 / 154|0.64935%|7.14286%|0.88384%|
|5|5 / 462|1.08225%|9.52381%|1.38464%|
|6|5 / 308|1.62338%|11.90476%|1.99878%|

## Key
---

- P_hit(k) = probability the player gets both required cards with required orientations among a k card pool.
- P_pick(k) = probability to complete a Hit if the player guarantees one required oriented card before draw and draws a pool of total size k (so remaining random draws = k − 1).
- P_glimpse_lock(k) = probability to get a Hit when the Glimpse reveals one required oriented card pre-draw and the player may lock that card if it appears in the initial k pool, then redraw a single replacement card for the pool.

## Price

|Tier|Description|Price (points)|
|---|---|---|
|Base (k = 2)|Draw 2 cards|5,000|
|~~+1 card~~|~~Increase pool by 1 card~~|~~+4,000 each (0.8 × C)~~|
|~~k = 3 total~~|~~Draw 3 cards~~|~~9,000~~|
|~~k = 4 total~~|~~Draw 4 cards~~|~~13,000~~|
|~~k = 5 total~~|~~Draw 5 cards~~|~~17,000~~|
|~~k = 6 total~~|~~Draw 6 cards~~|~~21,000~~|
|~~Glimpse add-on~~|~~Reveal one required card and its orientation before draw (available only if k >= 4)~~|~~7,500 (1.5 × C)~~|
|~~Pick add-on~~|~~Guarantee one exact card and orientation; remaining draws proceed normally~~|~~30,000 (6 × C)~~|

## Example

- Base draw (k = 2, 5,000 points): "You will draw 2 cards. Orientations are random. Hit odds: 0.11%."
- Extra card (k = 3, 9,000 points): "Add one extra card to the pool for +4,000. Pool k = 3. Hit odds: 0.32%."
- Big spend + Pick (k = 2 + Pick, 35,000 points): "Guarantee one exact card and orientation for +30,000. Remaining draw Hit odds: 2.38%."
- k = 4 + Glimpse (13,000 + 7,500 = 20,500 points): "Pool size 4 and glimpse one required card and its orientation before the draw. If the hinted card appears you may lock it and redraw one other slot. Hit odds about 0.88%."

# Banners

A banner is a themed collection of possible rewards. Each one tied to a story, a mood, or a legend. When you draw from a banner, your tarot reading is aligned to that theme, and the fates choose from within its offerings. Some banners appear only for a short time, others must be unlocked, and each holds treasures unique to its design.

## Mechanics

When you make a tarot draw, you pull **two cards** from the deck, each face-down. Every card may appear **upright** or **reversed**, and each orientation changes its meaning. A perfect pairing—two cards whose meanings resonate with the banner you’ve chosen—creates a _Hit_, granting you one of that banner’s treasures.
