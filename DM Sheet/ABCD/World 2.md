# The Story Now
---
## Event 1: Summoning in the Greenwood Verge
The party is suddenly summoned into a dense, ancient forest known locally as the **Greenwood Verge**, a place steeped in old magic and watched by unseen forces.
The air is heavy and unfamiliar. Light filters through towering trees older than most kingdoms. Before the party can fully orient themselves, a **panicked scream** cuts through the forest.
The scream is human. It is close.
## Event 2: The Merchant Ambush
The party comes upon a small forest road where a **traveling merchant caravan** has been attacked.
### Scene Setup
- A merchant wagon lies partially overturned.
- Several crates are broken open.
- **Bandits**, coordinated and experienced, are directing **trained wolves** to harry the merchant.
- The merchant is wounded but still alive, desperately fending off attacks.
The bandits are not mindless criminals. They are organized, and the wolves respond to whistles and gestures.
This encounter is volatile and time-sensitive.
---
## Possible Outcomes
### Outcome A: Merchant Survives (Bandits Defeated or Driven Off)
**Immediate Result**
- The merchant survives, shaken but grateful.
- Any surviving bandits flee into the forest.
**Narrative Consequences**
- The merchant offers thanks, supplies, and information.
- He insists on repaying the party by guiding them.
**Follow-Up Travel Condition**
- The merchant must first stop at a **nearby village** to tend wounds and secure goods.
- From there, he can arrange passage or directions to:
    
    - Kingdom of Aurelion
    
    - Sanctum of Solythea
    
    - Ashkara Pridelands
    
    - Information about the former Demon King’s castle
    
The village serves as an early social hub and soft introduction to the post-war world.
---
### Outcome B: Bandits Survive (Merchant Dies)
**Immediate Result**
- The merchant is slain.
- One or more bandits survive, either surrendering or retreating.
**Narrative Consequences**
- Surviving bandits assess the party cautiously.
- They are pragmatic, not fanatical.
**Follow-Up Travel Condition**
- The bandits offer guidance, but only after returning to their **forest stronghold**.
- Their stronghold introduces:
    
    - Criminal politics
    
    - Lingering post-war instability
    
    - Rumors of demon relics and forbidden magic
    
Bandits can guide the party anywhere eventually, but at slower speed and with morally gray complications.
---
### Outcome C: Merchant and Bandits Both Survive
**Immediate Result**
- The fight ends in a stalemate or forced separation.
- Both sides disengage.
**Narrative Consequences**
- The party must choose whom to trust.
- Either can act as a guide, but not both.
**Follow-Up Travel Condition**
- Choosing the merchant leads to the village route.
- Choosing the bandits leads to the stronghold route.
- The unchosen faction may resurface later, remembering the party’s decision.
---
### Outcome D: Merchant and Bandits All Die
This outcome triggers a **special, hidden encounter**.
---
## Special Event: Guardian of the Greenwood Verge
### The Giant Mystic Wolf Appears
As silence settles over the battlefield, the forest grows unnaturally still.
A low, resonant growl echoes through the trees.
From the shadows emerges a **giant mystic wolf**, its fur silver-gray and faintly luminous, eyes glowing with ancient intelligence. The forest itself seems to yield to its presence.
This being is a **Guardian of the Greenwood Verge**, a remnant of old pacts predating the kingdoms.
---
## Special Interaction: Mistaken Identity
The wolf’s gaze locks onto **Edward**.
It approaches calmly, respectfully.
It speaks.
Not aloud, but directly into the mind.

> “It has been some time, Hero. You look… different. Have the years of peace treated you well?”
The wolf assumes Edward is **the Hero of the Great War**.
Regardless of Edward’s response:
- The wolf listens politely.
- The wolf does not correct itself.
- The wolf is convinced.

> “Retirement suits you poorly, it seems. Tell me, where does your path lead now?”
Edward does not know:
- He is the younger brother of the true hero.
- The resemblance is not physical, but spiritual.
The guardian senses **lineage**, not memory.
---
## Guardian’s Aid
Once the party names a destination, the mystic wolf agrees to guide them.
### Travel Benefits
- The wolf and its unseen pack can move the party **anywhere within a single day**, regardless of distance.
- This includes:
    
    - Any of the three kingdoms
    
    - The ruins of the former Demon King’s castle

### The Timber's Blessing Festival
**Event Overview**
An annual three-day festival celebrating the village's survival and prosperity. Officially honors "the forest's blessing," but the true purpose is to secretly honor the Hero who saved the village during the war.
**The Village's Secret**
During the Great War, a demon warband cornered fleeing refugees near what would become Thornhaven. The Hero arrived, fought through the night, and held the demons back long enough for the refugees to escape into the deep forest. Those refugees founded Thornhaven. The villagers were told never to acknowledge the Hero if he returned, so they created this "festival" as their way of honoring him in secret.
**When the Party Arrives**
The village is decorated with wooden carvings, lanterns, and flower garlands. Villagers are preparing for the evening's main celebration.
When Edward enters:
- Conversations pause briefly, then resume with forced casualness
- Villagers steal glances but don't stare
- Children whisper excitedly until parents gently shush them
- Several villagers suddenly "remember" urgent tasks elsewhere, then return moments later trying to act natural
**The Treatment**
_Toward Edward:_
- The party is offered the "guest lodge" - the nicest building in town, usually reserved for important merchants
- Garrick insists Edward take the head seat at communal meals, citing "you look tired from travel"
- Villagers bring small gifts: carved figures, preserved foods, a "lucky" timber charm - all presented as "festival tradition for travelers"
- During conversations, villagers frequently mention how grateful they are for "second chances" and "those who protect the helpless"
- Merra "accidentally" makes Edward's favorite tea without asking his preference, then acts surprised it's exactly right
- Finn offers to sharpen Edward's weapons "as thanks for listening to my stories," doing an exceptional job
_Toward the Rest of the Party:_
- Warm and welcoming, offering food and drink freely
- Genuine interest in their stories and backgrounds
- Asked respectful questions: "How did you all meet?" "What brings you together?"
- Given comfortable accommodations and included in all festivities
- Treated as honored guests, but with slightly less intensity than Edward
- Villagers express admiration: "You must be good people to travel with such a fine companion"
**Festival Events**
▶**The Timber Raising Ceremony** (Afternoon)
Villagers work together to raise a massive carved timber pole in the village center. The pole is inscribed with symbols of protection and gratitude.
- Edward is asked to help with the "honor position" on the main rope
- When it's raised, villagers cheer and several quietly wipe tears
- Garrick makes a speech about "remembering those who held the line when darkness came"
▶**The Story Circle** (Evening)
Elder villagers share "old tales" around a great bonfire. The stories are thinly-veiled retellings of the night the Hero saved them.
- One story describes "a stranger with kind eyes who stood alone against the tide"
- Another mentions "the protector who asked nothing in return"
- Children act out the stories with wooden swords, always casting the "hero" as brave and selfless
- The party is invited to share their own stories; villagers listen with rapt attention
▶**The Gratitude Feast** (Night)
A massive communal meal with everyone in the village.
- The first serving is placed before Edward before anyone else eats
- Toasts are made "to those who give us tomorrow" and "to strangers who become saviors"
- Quiet moments where villagers approach Edward, thank him for "visiting our humble village," with unusual emotion
- Music and dancing follow, with Edward repeatedly asked to dance ("it's tradition for honored guests")
- Party members are also invited to dance and celebrate, asked about their adventures
**Subtle Hints (Easy to Miss)**
- The carved timber pole has a symbol that matches a technique Edward might use, but it's abstract enough to be coincidence
- Merra mentions she had "two brave sons once" and looks at Edward with profound sadness and gratitude
- Children's play-acting describes the hero's fighting stance with surprising accuracy to Edward's style
- A carved wooden figure gifted to Edward depicts a warrior in a pose similar to one Edward uses
**What the Party Learns**
The party comes away thinking:
- These are incredibly kind, generous people who love celebrating life
- The festival is a beautiful tradition honoring survival and community
- The villagers seem especially fond of Edward, probably because he's naturally likeable
- They're deeply grateful people who haven't forgotten the war's cost

### The Festival of Answered Prayers
**Event Overview**
A solemn yet joyful three-day religious festival celebrating divine intervention and miraculous salvation. Officially commemorates "the day the Supreme God answered our prayers," but truly honors the Hero who saved the village.
**The Village's Secret**
During the war, a demon cult attempted to corrupt Pilgrim's Rest and use it as a staging ground to attack the Sanctum itself. The Hero arrived during a dark ritual, drove out the cultists, and purified the temple grounds. The villagers prayed desperately that night, and the Hero was their answer. Following the Hero's request for anonymity, they frame the celebration as divine intervention - which, in their hearts, it was.
**When the Party Arrives**
The village is adorned with white ribbons, prayer bells, and sacred candles. A peaceful reverence fills the air.
When Edward enters:
- Brother Aldric's hand trembles slightly as he greets them
- Matron Elara's eyes glisten with tears she quickly blinks away
- Villagers bow slightly - a gesture usually reserved for clergy
- Several villagers make subtle hand signs of blessing toward Edward
- Thom stares in open wonder before someone nudges him to look away
**The Treatment**
_Toward Edward:_
- The party is offered rooms in the temple's pilgrim quarters - the most sacred lodging available
- Brother Aldric insists Edward take the "room of honored rest," explaining it's "tradition for the most weary traveler"
- Meals are brought to Edward first, portions slightly larger and more carefully prepared
- Villagers approach with small offerings: prayer beads, blessed water, sacred herbs - "gifts for protection on your journey"
- During prayers, Brother Aldric's words echo themes of "returned blessings" and "those who walk among us unseen"
- Matron Elara "happens" to prepare Edward's meals exactly to his taste, claiming "divine inspiration"
- Villagers find excuses to stand near Edward, as if proximity itself brings comfort
_Toward the Rest of the Party:_
- Welcomed warmly as "companions of a blessed traveler"
- Offered prayers and blessings for their safety
- Asked gentle questions: "How did you come to travel together?" "What guides your path?"
- Included in all ceremonies and given places of honor
- Treated with deep respect and genuine care
- Villagers express quiet admiration: "You must have good souls to walk beside such a person"

- One account speaks of "a warrior with gentle hands who restored what was broken"

- Brother Aldric leads a prayer of thanks, speaking directly toward Edward but phrasing it as a general blessing
- Soft hymns follow, with harmonies that seem to wrap around Edward specifically
- Party members are asked if they'd like to share their own stories of hope or gratitude
**Subtle Hints (Easy to Miss)**
- The shrine has a carved symbol that resembles a sword technique Edward knows, but abstracted into a holy symbol
- Brother Aldric mentions that "our savior had kind eyes" while looking at Edward, then quickly looking away
- Children draw pictures of "the blessed warrior" that coincidentally resemble Edward's general build and bearing
- Thom, in his enthusiasm, nearly says something revealing but is quickly interrupted by an elder
- Matron Elara whispers "Thank you for coming back" when serving Edward, then quickly adds "to our village, I mean"
**What the Party Learns**
The party comes away thinking:
- These are deeply faithful, peaceful people who've survived something traumatic
- The festival is a beautiful expression of sincere religious devotion

### The Festival of the Unbowed Warrior

**The Camp's Secret**
During the war, Crosswind Camp was surrounded by a massive demon force. Outnumbered five to one, the warriors prepared for their final stand. The Hero arrived with reinforcements and fought for three days straight without rest, rallying the defenders and turning certain death into legendary victory.

# The Past
---
### The Age of Desperation
For centuries, the demon race encroached upon the mortal world under the rule of the Demon King, whose armies threatened the extinction of all civilized peoples. Humanity stood fractured, divided into rival kingdoms and ideologies, unable to resist the demonic tide alone.
At the brink of annihilation, a higher power intervened. Through a forbidden summoning ritual sanctioned by divine authority, heroes were called forth from another world. These summoned heroes became symbols of hope and unity, rallying the fractured nations into a single coalition.
This act was not publicly framed as divine desperation, but rather as destiny fulfilled.
### The Great War Against the Demon King - The Three Kingdoms United
When the Demon King’s armies first crossed the outer borders, it was the Kingdom of Aurelion that stood nearest to the storm.
The summoned hero arrived at the royal court bearing proof of the higher power’s mandate. King Altharion of Aurelion gave his support without hesitation, recognizing that divided crowns would doom all realms. The Royal Faction rallied behind the hero, opening the kingdom’s armies, vaults, and roads to the coming war.
The Noble Faction, however, resisted.
Many aristocrats viewed the hero as an outsider and the war as an opportunity rather than a threat. Some argued for isolation, others for appeasement. A few, already whispering with darker powers, openly challenged the king’s authority. Without noble levies and resources, Aurelion’s strength was fractured.
Seeing that words would not sway them, the hero left the court.
The journey led south to the Ashkara Pridelands, where strength alone determined worth. There, the hero faced the High Chieftain of the Ashkara Conclave. Rather than plead, the hero fought alongside the tribes against a demon incursion that had already breached their lands. Blood was spilled, bonds were forged, and through trial and battle the hero proved worthy.
The High Chieftain knelt not in submission, but in recognition. The Ashkara Conclave pledged their warriors to the coming war.
From the Pridelands, the hero traveled to the Sanctum of Solythea.
Within the sacred halls, the High Priestess tested not the hero’s strength, but his intent. Through ritual, vision, and divine scrutiny, she weighed his soul before the Supreme God. When the rites were complete, the High Priestess proclaimed that the hero’s cause aligned with Solythea’s will and bestowed a public blessing upon him.
This blessing carried immense weight.
News of the Ashkara’s pledge and Solythea’s favor spread quickly. The Noble Faction of Aurelion found themselves isolated. To oppose the hero now was to stand against both divine will and proven strength.
One by one, the nobles relented. Some out of conviction, others out of fear, and a few with hidden resentment.
Thus, the Three Kingdoms were united.
Not by treaty alone, but by trial, faith, and the undeniable truth that none would survive the Demon King alone.
From that moment, the war ceased to be a series of desperate defenses. It became a crusade.
### The Summoned Hero and the Mage
Among the summoned heroes was one who would lead the final charge against the Demon King. Unknown to all others, this hero carried dormant demonic power inherited from his father, a secret he never shared.
A human mage traveled alongside the hero throughout the war. Intelligent and observant, the mage began noticing subtle inconsistencies surrounding the hero. Small details, improbable survivals, and moments of unnatural strength planted seeds of suspicion.
At first, these doubts were dismissed even by the mage himself.
Everything changed during a battle against a demon general. The hero, on the brink of death, unconsciously awakened his sealed demonic power and annihilated the general in a display that defied mortal magic.
The mage was the sole witness.
From that moment, the mage became convinced the hero was a demon in disguise. He attempted to warn the rest of the party, but they dismissed his claims as paranoia born of exhaustion and fear. The hero’s reputation and consistent compassion outweighed a single mage’s testimony.
Unable to abandon his conviction, the mage resolved to uncover the truth alone.
### The Broken Alliance
The mage secretly prepared a trap that would isolate the hero. His intent was absolute. If the hero was a demon, the mage would sacrifice his own life to destroy him.
When the trap was sprung, the mage attacked without hesitation.
The hero refused to fight back, denying the accusation and insisting on his loyalty to humanity. The mage pressed the assault relentlessly, forcing the hero into desperation.
Cornered and left with no alternative, the hero used some unknown power to escape.
This act neither confirmed nor denied his fears.
The mage began casting a self sacrificial spell designed to annihilate both of them. The hero overpowered him at the final moment, forcibly interrupting the spell.
What followed was not a battle, but a confession.
The hero told a half-truth about his power but swore his allegiance to humanity and his intent to destroy the Demon King. To prove this, he proposed a magical contract.
The pact was absolute. The hero would defeat the Demon King and then leave the world forever peacefully. The mage would continue aiding the hero until the war’s end. If either broke the contract, death would follow.
Bound by magic and conviction, the mage accepted.
### The Fall of the Demon King
The war reached its conclusion. With the summoned heroes at the forefront, the Demon King was slain, and his armies scattered.
True to the contract, the hero departed this world, returning to the realm from which he was summoned. His existence, origin, and final fate became a carefully curated legend.
The mage kept the hero’s secret. Outwardly, he was remembered as a loyal ally and war hero.
Inwardly, the mage never abandoned his fear.
### The Hidden Preparations
Believing vigilance was humanity’s only safeguard, the mage began preparing for a future where the hero might return as a new Demon King.
To prevent such a catastrophe, the mage secretly claimed the Demon King’s sword, a relic saturated with abyssal power. He sealed it within a private pocket dimension known only to himself.
There, the mage began long term contingency planning. Research, countermeasures, and forbidden magic were pursued quietly, all in the name of protecting the world from a threat that might never come.
### The Official Lie
The rulers of all three kingdoms agreed on a single deception.
The truth of the heroes’ otherworldly origin was suppressed. The people were told that the great hero had chosen to retire in peace after the war.
Citizens were instructed that if they ever encountered the hero again, they should pretend not to recognize him. This was framed as a final honor, a way to grant the savior the quiet life he deserved.
In reality, this lie ensured the world would never grow dependent on foreign champions again.
### The World at Rest
The Demon King was dead. The kingdoms stood united, scarred but stronger. Faith, monarchy, and tribal strength found a fragile equilibrium.
Yet beneath the peace lay secrets, sealed weapons, binding contracts, and the unanswered question of whether the hero’s power was truly gone from the world forever.
This is the world as it stands when the players arrive.
  
# The Kingdoms
---
## The Monarchical Kingdom - Kingdom of Aurelion
### Summary
Ruled by a kind and wise king, this realm operated under a fragile balance of power between the Royal Faction and the Noble Faction.
During the war, fractures within the noble class widened. Several powerful aristocrats, driven by greed and fear, secretly sided with the demons in exchange for promises of survival or dominion. These betrayals cost countless lives.
As the war dragged on, evidence of treason surfaced. With the support of the king and war heroes, the most corrupt nobles were purged or stripped of power. The Noble Faction survived, but permanently weakened, while royal authority emerged dominant in the post war era.
### The Royal Family
- **Prince Caelum** _(KAY-lum)_
    
    The eldest child and heir to the throne. Calm, disciplined, and heavily burdened by expectation, Caelum was the primary target of noble political maneuvering.
    
- **Princess Elowen** _(EL-oh-wen)_
    
    The elder daughter, known for her sharp intellect and diplomatic talent. Many nobles underestimated her, often to their regret.
    
- **Princess Mireya** _(mih-RAY-uh)_
    
    The youngest, beloved by the people for her warmth and presence. Her popularity made her a symbolic prize among ambitious houses.
    
- **King Altharion III** _(al-THAIR-ee-on)_,
    
    Known in history as _the Gilded Lion_.
    
- **Queen Seraphine** _(SEH-rah-feen)_
### The Five Pillars of Aurelion
The crown’s true strength lay not only in lineage, but in loyalty.
These were the greatest defenders of the realm, sworn directly to the king and operating beyond noble authority.
1. **Sir Aldric Veynholm** _(AL-drik VAYN-holm)_
    
    _First Pillar, Swordsmaster_
    
    A peerless duelist whose techniques shaped modern Aurelion swordplay. He served as both champion and master-at-arms to the royal guard.

1. **Archmage Corvellan Rhys** _(kor-VELL-an REES)_

1. **Sir Garron Stoneward** _(GAIR-on STONE-ward)_
    
    _Fourth Pillar, Steadfast Guardian_
    
    Commander of the Shieldbearers and personal protector of the royal family. Known for holding a fortress gate alone for three days during a border uprising.
    
1. **The Last Shadow**
    
    _Fifth Pillar_
    
    Officially nonexistent.
    
    Whispers speak of a hidden agent who removed threats before they reached the throne. Only the king, queen, and the First Pillar were said to know the Shadow’s true identity.
    
Beyond the Pillars, the king commanded a professional standing army, loyal advisors, veteran strategists, and lifelong companions forged through shared campaigns.
### Royal Faction Supporters
High Strategist of Aurelion
**Lord Vaelis Crownholm**
_(VAY-liss KROWN-holm)_
### The Noble Faction
### Summary
Aurelion’s noble houses were wealthy, influential, and deeply divided.
Different families controlled banks, merchant guilds, trade fleets, arcane academies, mercenary legions, and private armies. Though they presented a unified front against royal reform, they constantly undermined one another through economic sabotage, espionage, and political manipulation.
Marriage was their favored weapon.
- Noble daughters were encouraged to court **Prince Caelum**, aiming to bind the crown to their house.
- Noble sons were pushed toward **Princess Elowen** or **Princess Mireya**, seeking influence through proximity.
King Altharion allowed these maneuvers to continue. He understood that as long as the nobles competed with one another, they could never truly unite against the crown.
  
**Post War Reforms Affecting the Houses**
No noble house may maintain a private army above crown regulated limits.
Banking and arcane research are subject to royal audit.
Noble succession laws require crown approval.
Treason trials are now conducted by joint royal noble tribunals.

### The Age of Veiled Crowns
The Kingdom of **Aurelion** _(aw-REL-ee-on)_ was long regarded as the most stable realm on the continent. Its banners flew unchallenged, its laws were respected, and its throne appeared unassailable.
Beneath that stability, however, lay a quiet struggle for power.
At the center of the realm ruled **King Altharion III** _(al-THAIR-ee-on)_, known in history as _the Gilded Lion_. He was a ruler of patience and foresight, favoring restraint over force and long planning over short victories.
By his side stood **Queen Seraphine** _(SEH-rah-feen)_, a woman of keen political intuition. She possessed an unmatched understanding of noble alliances and rivalries, often seeing betrayal before it fully formed.
### Betrayal During the Great War
When the Demon King’s influence spread, it found willing listeners among the most ambitious nobles.
Promises of survival, dominion, and future power tempted those who believed the war could be exploited rather than endured. Supply lines were sabotaged. Defensive plans were leaked. Assassination attempts came dangerously close to success.
On multiple occasions, Aurelion stood at the edge of collapse.
Only the intervention of the summoned hero, the vigilance of the Five Pillars, and decisive action by the king prevented disaster. Several noble houses were exposed as traitors. Their titles were revoked, assets seized, and in the most extreme cases, their names erased from official history.
The Noble Faction emerged broken and diminished.
### Present Account
### The Golden Concord
After the Demon King’s defeat, **King Altharion III** enacted sweeping reforms designed not as punishment, but as prevention.
A formal system of checks and balances was established.
- Noble authority became transparent and regulated.
- Military command was centralized under the crown.
- Economic monopolies were dismantled.
- Governance councils were formed, consisting of royal representatives, vetted nobles, and neutral magistrates.
The surviving noble houses adapted. Greed did not vanish, but it was constrained. Cooperation replaced intrigue, as unchecked ambition had nearly destroyed the realm.
**Prince Caelum** _(KAY-lum)_ now serves as Crown Regent, overseeing internal governance while preparing for kingship.
**Princess Elowen** _(EL-oh-wen)_ leads foreign diplomacy.
**Princess Mireya** _(mih-RAY-uh)_ stands as a symbol of reconciliation and unity.
The Five Pillars remain active, though the **Last Shadow** is rumored to have vanished after the war. Some believe their duty is complete. Others believe they simply wait.
Aurelion now stands in a true golden age, maintained not by fear, but by balance.
## The Theocratic Kingdom - The Sanctum of Solythea
### Summary
This kingdom worshipped a pantheon unified under a Supreme God. While other gods were honored, all were understood to serve the divine will of the Supreme God.
Leadership flowed through a strict religious hierarchy. The High Priestess stood at the apex, followed by elders, bishops, and clergy.
The war was interpreted as a divine trial. Their armies and miracle wielders fought with fanatic resolve, believing victory or extinction to be equally holy outcomes. Their faith strengthened during the war, and their religious authority expanded afterward.
### Hierarchy

**Key Features:**
- Absolute unity; corruption is nonexistent.
- All citizens are expected to uphold the moral code, but enforcement is compassionate rather than punitive.
- Education, magical practice, and governance are intertwined with faith.

## The Tribal Confederation - The Ashkara Pridelands
### Summary
Comprised of mixed race humanoids, this society was once marginalized and oppressed by the other kingdoms.
Their culture was tribal, merit based, and forged through strength. Leadership of all tribes belonged to the strongest and most worthy champion, chosen through trial and conquest.
During the war, the tribal warriors became indispensable. Their ferocity, adaptability, and willingness to fight demons where others could not turned the tide of multiple campaigns.
After the war, their sacrifices could no longer be ignored. The confederation emerged as an equal among nations, no longer tolerated but respected. Trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange flourished, and their society entered an era of prosperity.

- **Tribal Council** – A group of the strongest chieftains advising the High Chieftain; ensures each tribe has a voice.
