The world was perfect in the way only dreams can be — saturated colors, no awkward silences, hair that stayed exactly right.

Peak moved through the gym like he owned it. And today, he did. The bar was loaded heavier than it had ever been, the kind of weight that made other guys in the gym quietly put down their phones and watch. He set his grip, pulled air into his chest, and drove. The weight moved. Clean. Smooth. The kind of rep that didn't need a spotter's encouragement or a second attempt. A few guys nearby nodded with that silent gym respect that meant more than words.

PR. Clean. Done.

He toweled off without rushing. That was the thing about Peak in this world — he never rushed. Everything came to him in its own time, and its own time was always good.

The barbershop was a few blocks from campus. His barber, a quiet professional who worked like a surgeon, shaped him up without needing much direction. Peak watched himself in the mirror as the final details came together and allowed himself a small, satisfied nod. Valedictorian. Number one in the nation. And now this. Some days just aligned.

The mall was busy for a weekday afternoon, the kind of crowd that filled space without feeling chaotic. Peak moved through it easily, catching the rhythm of the place — music bleeding out of storefronts, the smell of food court grease mixing with cologne samples, the general hum of people spending money they'd justify later.

He stopped at the small drink kiosk near the center atrium. Nothing fancy, just something cold. The girl behind the counter was pretty in an effortless way, the kind of pretty that didn't announce itself. She made his drink with practiced ease and slid it across the counter with a smile that lingered just a half second longer than customer service required.

He noticed. She noticed that he noticed.

When he picked up the cup, there was a number written just below the logo in black marker. He looked up. She had already turned back to the next customer, but the corner of her mouth was still turned up.

Peak pocketed the information and kept moving.

He had just stepped into one of the larger clothing stores, thumbing through a rack with the unhurried confidence of someone who knew his size and knew what worked, when a woman in a blazer and a headset approached him with the focused energy of someone on a deadline.

"Excuse me," she said, already pulling out her phone to show him something. "I know this is completely out of nowhere, but I work with Lumière Agency. We're running a shoot here in the mall today — couples concept — and one of our models called out an hour ago." She looked at him plainly. "You have the look. Are you available right now?"

Peak considered this for approximately two seconds.

"Yeah," he said. "I'm available."

---

The shoot was set up in the east wing of the mall, a section they had temporarily closed off and transformed into something that looked like it belonged in a magazine. Clean lighting rigs, a photographer moving with purpose, assistants adjusting small details with the intensity of people who understood that small details were the entire job.

And then Peak saw who he would be shooting with.

Yuna Sato stood at the center of it all like she had been placed there by the universe itself. Model, cosplayer, actress — the girl who had played Marin in the live action adaptation of My Dress Up Darling and had, in doing so, become the kind of celebrity that transcended categories. She had that quality that cameras loved and people couldn't quite explain, the ability to be completely present in whatever world she was currently occupying. Right now she was occupying this mall in this city and she turned when Peak approached and looked at him the way people look at something that pleasantly surprises them.

"You must be the replacement," she said.

"Peak," he said.

"Yuna." She smiled. "Try to keep up."

He did. More than kept up. The photographer found their rhythm quickly — two people who moved well and understood space and didn't make the camera work for it. The concept was close, warm, the kind of editorial that implied a story between two people without spelling it out. Yuna was a professional down to her bones, but somewhere between the third and fourth setup she stopped directing her energy purely at the lens and started directing some of it at him.

They were midway through the shoot, repositioned for a new setup, when the atmosphere shifted.

He came from the small crowd of onlookers that had gathered behind the barriers — a young man whose expression had curdled somewhere past obsession into something that had no healthy name. He pushed past a barrier, pointing at Peak with a shaking finger, his voice cracking as it rose above the ambient noise of the mall.

"You don't get to touch her." His eyes were fixed on Peak with the intensity of someone who had constructed an entire private reality around a person who did not know he existed. "She's not for you. She's not for anyone like you. She's—"

He was already moving forward.

> [!important]
> 
> **Choice A: Calm De-escalation**
> 
> - **Action:** Peak steps forward slowly, hands visible, and speaks to the stalker in a low, steady voice — addressing him directly, keeping himself between the stalker and Yuna, and talking him down before security can reach them.
>     
> - **Result:** The stalker, destabilized by the absence of the conflict he came looking for, falters and is detained by security without further incident. The crowd watches in stunned silence. Yuna watches Peak with an expression that is difficult to read and then, slowly, becomes easier to read.
>     
> 
> **Choice B: Physical Interception**
> 
> - **Action:** Peak reads the stalker's trajectory and moves to cut him off, using his body as a wall — a single, controlled grab that stops the advance cold and holds until security arrives.
>     
> - **Result:** The stalker thrashes, spits words that don't land, and is removed. Peak straightens his collar. The photographer, without missing a beat, captures the moment. It ends up being the best shot of the day.
>     
> 
> **Choice C: Dramatic Redirect**
> 
> - **Action:** Peak steps directly into the stalker's path and looks at him with the kind of calm that is more unsettling than anger — and says, quietly, "She's working. You're interrupting her work." Nothing else. Just that.
>     
> - **Result:** The stalker's momentum breaks. Something in the framing of it — not a challenge, not a dismissal, just a fact — collapses whatever script he had prepared. Security is on him before he can rebuild it. The crowd exhales collectively.
>     

Security escorted him out. The crew exchanged glances. Someone started clapping — one of the assistants, then the photographer, then the small crowd behind the barriers, then everyone at once. Yuna exhaled through a smile that was half relief and half something else.

They finished the shoot.

When the last setup wrapped and the lighting rigs began coming down, Yuna found Peak near the edge of the set, jacket back on, looking like someone who had almost forgotten to be impressed by his own afternoon.

"You're not in the industry," she said. It wasn't a question.

"Student," he said.

She nodded slowly. "Are you—" She paused. Reconsidered. Decided. "Are you single?"

Peak looked at her. She looked back. The mall hummed around them, indifferent and fluorescent and completely unaware that something was happening in its east wing.

"Yeah," he said. "I am."

She opened her mouth.

Peak's eyes opened to a popcorn ceiling.

The room assembled itself around him in the slow, unglamorous way that rooms do — the blue light of a monitor left on overnight, the specific silence of an apartment building at seven in the morning, the weight of a body pillow pulled close in sleep that his arms had apparently decided to hold onto with some commitment. The pillow cover featured a girl with pastel hair and an expression of serene contentment. She had a name. It was written along the bottom edge in stylized kanji.

He lay there for a moment.

There had been something. A dream. Something good — he could feel the residue of it the way you feel warmth after stepping out of sunlight, present but already fading. A girl. Maybe two girls. Something about a camera. He reached for it and found only the outline, the shape of a feeling without its contents, and then even that was going.

His phone alarm went off. Not music — a flat, functional tone he had never bothered to change.

He silenced it and sat up.

On his desk: three empty instant ramen cups stacked with architectural precision, a figurine of a silver-haired character posed mid-attack, a laptop with seventeen browser tabs and a Crunchyroll window left open, and a sticky note in his own handwriting that read **WALMART 8AM DON'T FORGET.**

He was on his feet in four minutes. Hygiene completed in seven. He pulled on a hoodie that had a faded logo from an anime that had ended two years ago, grabbed his backpack — the one with the enamel pins along the strap — and checked the time.

Still good. He could make it.

The new Pokémon card set dropped today. A specific, limited set. The kind of thing that moved fast and moved hard, and Peak had done his research — print run numbers, historical market comparisons, resale trajectory on three different platforms. He had a spreadsheet. He had a system.

He did not, he would tell you firmly and with some passion if you asked, think of himself as a scalper.

Scalpers were people who exploited markets unfairly. What Peak was doing was closer to — arbitrage, really. Supply and demand participation. He was a market corrector. He was providing liquidity to collectors who couldn't make it out in time by ensuring that product remained accessible through secondary channels at a price that reflected true market value as determined by organic buyer interest. He was, if anything, doing a service.

He locked his apartment door and headed for the stairs.

The dream was gone entirely now. Whatever it had been, it belonged to the night. Today was about the cards.

He had a line to get to.
