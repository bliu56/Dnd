## Timeline

### Age 6 — The Fire

- House catches fire. Shadow sees a shadow creature at her window before losing consciousness.
- Rescued by firefighters. Both parents die in the fire.
- Moves in with her uncle, **Bill**.
- Dismisses the creature as a trick of the smoke and fear. Does not speak of it.

### Ages 6–14 — Life with Bill

- Bill is quiet, undemanding. The closest thing to stability Shadow has known.
- Age 14 — wakes up to a cold sensation down her spine. Door and window open. Catches a glimpse of the shadow creature before it disappears.
- Falls asleep in class the next day. Dreams of her old home. A doll with Bill's face. Her hand goes dark. She hears a snap — real enough to feel in her bones.
- Wakes up. By the end of the school day, learns that Bill has slipped and fallen down the stairs. His neck is broken. He "dies," though something about the circumstances never sits quite right.
- Shadow denies any connection. She does not allow herself to think about it.
- Following Bill's death, Shadow enters the foster care system.

### Ages 14–20 — Foster Care

Shadow cycles through several placements. She does not cause trouble. Trouble finds the space around her anyway.

**Foster Family #1**

- A dog in the house scratches Shadow unprovoked.
- The dog is found dead the next morning.
- Shadow is moved.

**Foster Family #2**

- Objects around the house break without explanation. Repeated, unexplained electrical outages.
- No direct harm to anyone. The family requests she be relocated.

**Foster Family #3**

- A ex-military drill sergeant. Harsh, rigid, and particularly hard on Shadow.
- Ends up in the hospital with multiple broken limbs. Circumstances are unclear.
- Shadow is moved. No one asks her directly what happened. She wouldn't have an answer.

### High School — The Locker Incident

- Shadow develops a crush on a guy from school. A tennis player. Conventionally attractive in the way that feels completely out of her reach.
- Leaves a love letter in his locker. Anonymous.
- The next day, his locker is destroyed — metal bent, door hanging off its hinge. Rumors spread about a crazed, obsessive girl.
- Shadow was home that night. It doesn't matter.
- She does not pursue anyone again. She begins to understand that proximity to her is not safe for other people.

### Age 20 — Present

- Lives alone. Keeps to herself.
- No longer denies the creature is real. Has not for some time.
- The isolation is a decision, not a circumstance. She made it deliberately.
- Does not know what the creature is, what she is, or why any of this has followed her since she was six years old.
- She keeps the list of what she knows short. She keeps the list of what she suspects locked away.

## The Creature

- First appeared during the house fire when Shadow was 6.
- Reappeared at age 9, the night before Bill's death.
- Connection to events is consistent but never confirmed. Always ambiguous. Always deniable — except Shadow no longer tries to deny it.
- Seems tied to Shadow. Whether it protects her, haunts her, or is her remains unclear.

## Notes for Future Sessions

- Shadow's ugliness and isolation make her invisible to most people — something she has learned to use.
- Her bisexuality has had no outlet. She shut that part of herself down after the locker incident.
- The creature's pattern — appearing around harm, grief, or strong emotion — has not gone unnoticed by Shadow. She just doesn't say it out loud.
