The apartment was never quiet. Even at this hour, the city pressed in through the thin walls — the groan of a bus, the argument two floors down, the hiss of pipes that had been half-broken since before any of them moved in. Older had learned to sleep through all of it. What they could not sleep through was the silence on the other side of the bedroom door.

Their sister's room had been quiet for three days now.

No note. No call. No warning. Just a door left ajar one morning, a bed made with the same careful habit she always had, and then nothing. As if the city had simply opened its mouth and swallowed her whole.

Older stood in the hallway outside that door, staring at the thin line of darkness where it hadn't quite shut. Their hand rested on the frame but did not push. Not yet. The room felt like a wound that hadn't decided whether it was going to bleed.

Behind them, the rest of the apartment breathed. Mom was at the kitchen table with her hands wrapped around a cup of tea gone cold, the way she sat when she was thinking too hard about something she couldn't fix. Dad had not come out of their bedroom since yesterday afternoon. His back again, most likely, or maybe just the weight of knowing. Younger was on the couch, pretending to look at their phone, not fooling anyone.

They were all waiting. For a call, for a knock at the door, for some explanation that would make the shape of things recognizable again.

Older let their hand fall from the door frame.

The refrigerator was running low. They had noticed that morning — noticed it the way you notice a bruise you didn't remember getting. Their sister had always handled the shopping, the bills, the careful arithmetic of making too little stretch far enough. She kept a handwritten list on the side of the fridge, each item in her small, deliberate handwriting. Older looked at it now. Milk. Rice. The electric bill, due in eleven days with a number circled twice.

Older pulled the list free and folded it into their pocket.

They did not know yet what the next step would look like. The thought of filling her shoes felt almost absurd — she had been doing this since before Older was old enough to understand what it cost her. She had never complained. She had just done it, quietly and completely, the way some people carry things without ever setting them down.

But the numbers on that bill were real. The empty shelves were real. Their parents' worn hands and worn bodies were real, and neither of them was going back to the kind of work that had damaged them in the first place. That much Older knew without having to be told.

Younger looked up from the couch as Older moved toward the front door, pulling on a jacket.

"Where are you going?" Younger asked. The question was small, careful, the way questions get when people are afraid of the answers.

Older paused with one hand on the door.

"Out," they said. Then, softer: "I'll be back."

It wasn't a promise about where they were going or what they would do when they got there. They didn't know that yet. It was only a promise to return, which was the one thing they could guarantee.

The hallway outside the apartment smelled like old carpet and someone's cooking from a floor above. The elevator was broken again, so Older took the stairs, each step carrying them further from the quiet that had settled over the family like a held breath.

The city met them at the bottom — loud and indifferent and full of possibility for those willing to reach into it, no matter what they had to reach past to do so.

Older stepped outside.

Whatever came next, it started here.
