## Family

- **Eldest Sister** — Accountant. Primary breadwinner before her disappearance. Vanished without a trace, no note, no signs of foul play. Her absence is the inciting event of Older's story.
- **Parents** — Both have physically worn-down bodies from demanding labor earlier in life. Not disabled, but no longer working. Dependent on whoever steps up.
- **Younger** — The other sibling. Also a player character.

- **Employment:** Took a part-time job at **Panda Express** as a **wok cook**
    - Specifically works the wok station
    - Cooks decently well — this is a genuine skill
    - Legal, stable income but unlikely to cover everything the family needs long-term
