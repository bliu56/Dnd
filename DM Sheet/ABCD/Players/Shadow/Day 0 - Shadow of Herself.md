She does not remember much about the night her life ended. She was six years old.

What she does remember is heat. The kind that presses against your skin like a living thing, hungry and insistent. She remembers the orange glow bleeding under her bedroom door, the screaming of smoke alarms, and then — her window. Something at her window. A shape that had no business being a shape, dark against the dark, watching her with a stillness that the fire did not share.

Then nothing.

She woke up outside on a stranger's lawn, a fireman's jacket draped over her shoulders, the house behind her swallowed whole. Her parents did not come out. No one told her this directly. She understood it from the way the adults stopped talking when she looked at them.

She decided the thing at the window was not real. Smoke did that to your eyes. Fear did that to your mind. She filed it away and did not open that drawer again.

Her uncle was a quiet man who kept a tidy house and asked little of her. She was grateful for that. She was seven when she moved in, and for a time, the world felt like it had agreed to leave her alone.

She was nine when the cold woke her.

It moved down her spine like a finger dragged slowly along the bone. She surfaced from sleep to find her room wrong — door open, window open, the curtain breathing in and out with the night air. And there, at the edge of her vision, still dissolving as her eyes adjusted, something dark. The same stillness. The same shape.

By the time she was fully awake, it was gone. She told herself she had been half asleep. She told herself it meant nothing. She closed the window, closed the door, and lay in the dark until morning came.

She fell asleep in third period the next day.

She dreamed of home — the old home, before the fire. She was on the living room floor with her dolls arranged in a circle around her. She picked up one she didn't remember owning. It had her uncle's face, or something close enough to it. She turned it over in her hands, examining it the way children examine things they don't quite trust.

Her hand went dark.

Not the dark of shadow or low light. Something else entirely, something that seeped up from beneath her skin like ink through paper. She felt it more than saw it. And then, without deciding to, she heard the snap.

The sound was very specific. Very final.

She woke up at her desk. The classroom continued around her as if nothing had occurred. She said nothing. She kept her hands in her lap and looked at them for a long time.

By lunch, word had moved through the school the way bad news always does — quickly, quietly, and with a particular kind of weight. Her uncle had fallen down the stairs that morning. They said his neck had snapped on impact.

She ate her lunch. She did not cry. She did not know what to do with what she knew, so she chose, again, to know nothing.

The foster system is not unkind so much as it is indifferent. She moved through it the way water moves through a cracked foundation — finding the gaps, settling in briefly, then moving on when the pressure built too high.

She was eleven at the first house. Twelve at the second. She lost count after a while. She did not cause trouble deliberately. Trouble simply had a way of finding the space around her. A pet that wouldn't stop scratching at her door and was found dead in the morning. A foster sibling who dreamed badly every night she was there and couldn't say why. Small things. The kind of things you couldn't point to directly.

She stopped trying to explain. Explaining required believing, and she had not yet given herself permission to believe.

She was sixteen when she made the mistake of feeling something for someone.

He sat two rows ahead of her in English. He laughed easily and didn't seem to notice her, which at the time felt like a safe distance from which to admire a person. She wrote the letter carefully, folded it twice, and slipped it through the vent of his locker before first period.

By the next morning, the story had already changed shape. There was a girl, people said, who had torn up his locker in some kind of obsession. His locker, by all accounts, did look like something had gone through it — metal bent, the door hanging off its hinge. He seemed more shaken than he let on.

She had been home all night. She knew that. It didn't matter.

She did not write any more letters. She did not allow herself that kind of proximity again.

By twenty, she has learned the particular discipline of distance. She keeps her apartment sparse. She keeps her schedule predictable. She does not let people in, not because she fears them, but because she has spent enough years watching what happens to people in her orbit.

She does not speak about the shadow. She has not spoken about it to anyone, ever. But she no longer tells herself it isn't real. That particular lie wore out somewhere around sixteen, when she stood in a hallway staring at a mangled locker and understood, in the cold and quiet part of herself, that denial was just a word for the time before you knew better.

She does not know what it wants. She does not know what she is.

She knows only that it has followed her since she was six years old, and that it has never once left her unattended for long.

She keeps her hands where she can see them.
