The alarm went off at 5:47 AM. Over had set it for 6:00, but he'd been awake since 4:30, staring at the ceiling with the particular kind of dread that had become her default state. Not fear exactly. Just the constant, low-humming awareness that there was always something he was forgetting, something he was already late on, something that was going to go wrong today.

he sat up. The room was small — textbooks stacked on the desk, a half-eaten protein bar on the nightstand, a sticky note on the mirror that just read _DON'T FORGET CHEN'S REPORT_ in her own handwriting. he didn't remember writing it, which meant he had written it at some point when he was scared enough to warn her future self.

The report wasn't due until Thursday. It was Tuesday. But with Mr. Chen, due dates were decorative. He'd asked for a "preliminary framework" by end of day Monday. he'd sent it at 11:58 PM. He'd replied at midnight with three bullet points of corrections and the words _see me first thing tomorrow_ at the bottom. No punctuation. No greeting. Just that.

Over was an intern.

he repeated that to herself sometimes, not as a complaint but as a reality check. _I am an intern. I am twenty years old. I am not supposed to know how to restructure a quarterly risk analysis report at midnight._ And yet.

he changed quickly, shoved her laptop into her bag alongside a financial accounting textbook he hadn't opened in four days, and left before he could think too hard about the schedule waiting on her phone.

The internship was at a firm he had been proud of getting. he'd told her family. he'd told her advisor. he had not, at the time, known what the inside of it looked like — the way the fluorescent lights buzzed just slightly too loud, the way nobody made eye contact in the elevator, the way her supervisor Mr. Chen moved through the office like a man perpetually disappointed in the architecture.

Her title was _Finance Intern – Operations Track_. In practice, this meant he reformatted spreadheets that full-time analysts didn't want to touch, drafted summary reports that Mr. Chen would rewrite entirely and send under his own name, and answered emails flagged URGENT that had been sitting in his inbox for three days already.

he had learned not to push back. The first time he'd said _I think there might be a conflict with my class schedule on Friday_, he had looked at her for a long moment and said, "This is a competitive program, Over." That was it. That was the whole sentence. he'd moved her class notes to her phone and taken them in the bathroom on her break.

None of her classmates had internships yet. They said things like _you're so lucky_ and _that's going to look amazing on your resume_. Over smiled and said _yeah_ because the alternative was explaining everything, and he didn't have the energy for that. he barely had energy for the internship itself.

The call center shift started at 6 PM and ended, theoretically, at 10. In practice it ended whenever the queue cleared, which on bad nights meant 10:45, sometimes 11, once — memorably — 11:58 on a Wednesday before a midterm.

he sat in a cubicle with a headset and a script he had long since memorized, handling billing complaints for a mid-tier home services company. The customers were, without exception, furious before he picked up. They had been on hold. They had been transferred. Someone had already told them something wrong. By the time they reached Over, they were past the point of wanting solutions — they wanted an audience for their anger, and he was required by policy to provide one.

_I understand your frustration._ Click. _I apologize for the inconvenience._ Click. _Let me see what I can do for you today._ Click click click.

he did her readings between calls when he could. Highlighted passages with one hand, headset cord draped over her shoulder, always half-listening for the next queue alert. Her notes from those sessions were disjointed — half a paragraph on capital asset pricing, then a bracketed note to herself: _[caller — screamed for 4 min, wanted $12 credit, gave $12 credit, moved on]_.

he did not complain about the job out loud. It paid. That was the metric he used. It paid, and he needed it to pay, and so he went.

By the time he got home most nights it was past 11. he'd eat whatever was fast, open her laptop, look at her task list, and feel the familiar tightening in her chest — that specific panic of someone who has too many things to do and has already been doing things all day.

he'd work until he couldn't anymore. Sometimes that was 1 AM. Sometimes 2. The sticky notes multiplied. The textbook stayed open to the same page for days at a time.

Over was a Business Finance major with a 3.7 GPA, an active internship, and a part-time job. On paper, he was doing everything right.

he just hadn't figured out yet how to feel like it.

> [!important]
> 
> **Choice A: Confront Mr. Chen**
> 
> - **Action:** Over puhes back on an unreasonable deadline, professionally but directly, citing her workload and class obligations.
>     
> - **Result:** Mr. Chen is visibly displeased. The tension in the office shifts. Over feels sick about it for the rest of the day — but the deadline gets moved by two days. A small, exhausting win.
>     
> 
> **Choice B: Ask a Coworker for Help**
> 
> - **Action:** Over quietly reaches out to one of the junior analysts, someone who seems less hostile than the rest, and asks for guidance on the report.
>     
> - **Result:** The analyst helps — cautiously, after hours, away from Mr. Chen's sight. Over finihes the report on time. he also learns, quietly, that he is not the first intern this has happened to.
>     
> 
> **Choice C: Do It All Alone**
> 
> - **Action:** Over says nothing, asks nothing, and grinds through the night to get it done.
>     
> - **Result:** The report is finihed. Mr. Chen sends back two corrections. Over misses a quiz the next morning because he slept through her alarm. Nobody at the firm notices or cares.
>     
> 
> **Choice D: Let Something Slip**
> 
> - **Action:** Over, stretched too thin, simply doesn't finish one of the tasks — the call center shift, the report, the assignment. he makes a choice, consciously or not, about what breaks first.
>     
> - **Result:** Consequences follow, small or large depending on what slipped. But for a few hours, the pressure drops just slightly. he sits with the guilt and the quiet, and it's almost a relief.
