## Current Situation

### Internship

- Company is a black company (exploitative, unreasonable culture)
- Boss: **Mr. Chen** — demanding, cold, unforgiving
- On Thursday morning, Over chose to prioritize his internship report over his school report
- Mr. Chen rejected the report and told Over to redo it, warning him he'd be **fired** if the redo wasn't good enough
- Over redid it — the result was average. Mr. Chen has not reacted yet. The verdict is still pending.

## Open Threads
