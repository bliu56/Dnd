The morning came in the way birthdays always do when you're no longer a child — quietly, without ceremony, like any other day that just happened to carry a little extra weight. The alarm on Injustice's phone buzzed at 6:45, and he silenced it before it could wake his grandfather.

He moved through the small house carefully. It was a habit now, almost instinct — avoid the creaky board near the hallway, don't let the bathroom faucet run too long, keep the television low. The house had learned to breathe softly around Grandpa, and so had he.

The smell of eggs and toast drifted from the kitchen before he even got there.

His grandmother stood at the stove with her back to him, still in her housecoat, her silver hair pinned up the way she always wore it in the mornings. She heard him come in and turned around with a smile that looked like it had been waiting all night to be used.

"Happy birthday, baby."

The words were simple. They always were with her. But they landed the way only her words could.

"Thank you, Grandma."

She waved him to the table and set a plate in front of him, then sat across from him with her own cup of coffee, watching him eat the way she always did — like the sight of him being fed was its own kind of satisfaction.

"I'm going to get your cake today," she said. "The one from that bakery on Mercer. You remember, the one your grandfather used to drive us to when you were small."

He remembered.

She was quiet for a moment, her fingers turning the coffee mug slowly. Then she looked at him — really looked at him — and her expression shifted into something softer and further away.

"You know," she began, "I look at you sometimes and I don't even know where the years went." She shook her head gently. "You grew up to be such a fine man. Your father would've —" She stopped herself. Pressed her lips together. Her eyes glistened for just a moment before she blinked it away. "Never mind me. I'm just being sentimental."

She reached across and patted his hand once, firmly, the way she did when a thing was settled.

"You're going to be late."

The school hallways smelled like floor wax and lunch trays that hadn't been properly cleaned. Injustice moved through the familiar noise of it — lockers slamming, conversations overlapping, sneakers squeaking on linoleum — and found his seat in third period without incident.

That was when Marcus walked in.

Everyone noticed. Not because Marcus was loud — he wasn't, not yet — but because of who followed him. Dillon Graves. Broad-shouldered, unhurried, wearing a jacket that cost more than most people's rent. He had two of his usual shadows with him, boys who had learned that orbiting Dillon was safer than standing anywhere else.

Dillon dropped into a seat near the back and immediately fixed his attention on Marcus like he had already decided the whole period was going to be about him.

It started small. A comment. A snicker from the shadows. Marcus's jaw tightened but he kept his eyes forward. Then something flicked against the back of his head and the whole back row suppressed laughter.

Injustice heard the whispers from the seats around him.

_"Why does he even go here?"_ _"His dad's loaded, right?"_ _"He got beat up at Whitmore Prep. Some scholarship kid knocked him out cold apparently. His dad pulled him out before it became a whole thing."_ _"So now he comes here where nobody's going to fight back."_ _"Did you see what his uncle got him? A race car. An actual race car. It's double parked in the lot right now."_

Injustice kept his eyes on his notebook and said nothing. But he was listening.

> [!important]
> 
> **Choice A: Step In**
> 
> - **Action:** Injustice intervenes directly, drawing Dillon's attention away from Marcus.
>     
> - **Result:** Dillon shifts his focus entirely onto Injustice. He studies him for a moment, then something shifts in his expression — something almost like amusement. "Oh wait," he says, "isn't today your birthday?" He asks what kind of cake Injustice likes. The classroom goes still.
>     
>     - **If Injustice answers:** Dillon smirks, says something like _"Good choice,"_ and leaves Marcus alone for the rest of the period. He and his shadows exit the classroom early without explanation.
>     - **If Injustice doesn't answer:** Dillon leans back. "I'll make you a deal. Tell me and I leave your boy alone today." If Injustice still says nothing, Dillon shrugs, unbothered. "I'm hurt, man. Genuinely." He nods at his shadows and they take Marcus out of the classroom with them. Injustice is left sitting there.
> 
> **Choice B: Tell a Teacher or Staff**
> 
> - **Action:** Injustice steps out and finds the nearest staff member, reporting what's happening.
>     
> - **Result:** The staff member listens. Nods. Says they'll look into it. They do not look into it. Later, Injustice overhears a teacher in the hallway say quietly, _"There's nothing I can do. You know whose kid that is."_ The principal has been golfing with Dillon's father for six years. Nobody in this building can afford to find out what happens when that relationship gets tested. Injustice is back where he started — and must now choose between stepping in or doing nothing.
>     
> 
> **Choice C: Mind His Own Business**
> 
> - **Action:** Injustice keeps his head down and doesn't get involved.
>     
> - **Result:** By the end of the period, Dillon has grown bored of the classroom. He and his shadows walk Marcus out the door. A teacher glances up and looks back down. Marcus does not come back for the rest of the day.

Either way, Dillon Graves eventually leaves.

He moves through the parking lot the way he moves through everything — like consequences are a concept that applies to other people. He gets into the car his uncle gave him, a low, loud thing that doesn't belong in a school parking lot, and pulls out without checking his mirrors.

Injustice doesn't know any of this yet.

He's still in school when it happens.

His grandmother had taken the bus to the bakery on Mercer, the one with the yellow awning that had been there since before he was born. She was on her way back, a white bakery box in both hands, when Dillon came around the corner too fast on a street where nobody drives that fast.

She didn't see it coming.

The doctors would say she was lucky. A broken wrist, two fractured ribs, a bad concussion. Lucky. Injustice would sit in the hospital waiting room and turn that word over in his mind until it didn't mean anything anymore.

By the next morning, the story had already changed shape. A witness account went missing. The traffic camera on that block had been experiencing technical difficulties, apparently. A police report was filed, but the details inside it were thin in the places that mattered most.

Dillon Graves was never mentioned by name.

The man who came to see Injustice two days later did not introduce himself as Dillon's father. He didn't have to. He was dressed quietly, expensively, and he sat across from Injustice with the calm of someone who had done this before and expected it to go the same way it always did.

He set an envelope on the table between them.

He did not push it forward. He did not explain it. He let it sit there.

"Medical bills add up," he said, in a tone that had no particular feeling in it. "Especially for families in your situation. Rehabilitation. Follow-up care. It becomes a real burden." He glanced at the envelope, then back at Injustice. "I think this covers it. And then some."

He stood, straightened his jacket, and looked at Injustice with eyes that were not unkind and not kind either — just steady, and very certain.

"I hope your grandmother recovers quickly," he said. "I really do."

He left the envelope on the table when he walked out.

Injustice sat there for a long time, the bakery box still on the kitchen counter where his grandfather had set it when they got home from the hospital — white, tied with string, unopened.

His grandmother had held onto it the whole time.
