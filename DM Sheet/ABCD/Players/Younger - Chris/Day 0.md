## Character Traits Established

- **Skeptic by nature.** When presented with the fortune teller's offer, Younger declined — even with the sense that the fortune teller knew more than she was letting on. Younger's instinct is to distrust what they can't verify, even when it might cost them something.
- **Highly attractive.** Worth keeping in mind for NPC interactions and social encounters going forward.

## Motivations

- **Finding the missing older sister is Younger's primary drive.** Everything else is secondary to this. It's the thread that will pull them forward through the story.

## Current Situation

- To help cover the household while the older sister is gone, Younger has taken a part-time job as a cook at Taco Bell.
- **She is not good at cooking.** This is established fact, not a temporary condition.

## Events This Session

- The fortune teller clearly knew more than she revealed. Younger initially walked away, but was convinced to go back by Older, who warned her she'd get AIDS if she didn't and that it was their best lead on finding their sister. Younger's skepticism didn't disappear — she was moved by the stakes, not by belief.
