The apartment was never quiet. Even at this hour, the city pressed in through the thin walls — the groan of a bus, the argument two floors down, the hiss of pipes that had been half-broken since before any of them moved in. Younger had never learned to sleep through all of it, not the way Older had. Instead they lay awake counting the sounds, naming them, making a map of everything that wasn't the silence on the other side of the wall.

Their sister's room had been quiet for three days now.

Younger was on the couch. Had been on the couch for most of the morning, phone face-up in their hands, not looking at it so much as holding it — the way you hold something when you're not sure what else to do with your hands. The screen had gone dark twice. They'd tapped it back to life both times without reading anything.

From here they could see almost all of it. Mom at the kitchen table, hands around a cup she'd stopped drinking from an hour ago. The hallway, and the thin line of darkness under their sister's door that Younger hadn't been able to stop looking at since yesterday. And Older — standing in front of that door now, one hand on the frame, not going in.

Younger watched without watching. It was something they had gotten good at.

They hadn't touched the door themselves. The thought had crossed their mind on the first day, that maybe if they looked inside they would find something that explained it — a note, a reason, some small thing their sister had left behind on purpose. But the room felt like something that should only be opened carefully, and Younger had not trusted themselves to be careful about it.

So they had stayed on the couch. They had watched.

They saw the moment Older let their hand fall. Saw them move to the fridge, pause, pull something free from the side of it. Their sister's list. Younger knew the handwriting without being close enough to read it. Small and deliberate, the kind of handwriting that meant you were trying not to waste the space.

Something shifted in Younger's chest, quiet and unnameable.

They had not thought about the list. Had not thought about the bills, the shopping, the careful arithmetic their sister had always managed without being asked. They had thought about her, where she was, whether she was cold, whether she was safe. Those thoughts had taken up everything. The rest of it — the mechanics of keeping the household breathing — had not yet found room.

Older folded the list into their pocket.

Younger looked back down at their phone. The screen was dark again. They did not tap it back to life this time.

The sounds of the apartment moved around them. Dad's door still closed. Mom's chair shifting slightly against the kitchen floor. The pipes. The city.

When Older moved toward the front door, pulling on their jacket, Younger looked up before they'd made a conscious decision to.

"Where are you going?" The question came out smaller than they meant it to. They hadn't meant it to sound like what it was — the question underneath the question, the one that was really asking _are you coming back_, or _don't go yet_, or something else entirely that Younger hadn't sorted out.

Older stopped with one hand on the door.

"Out." A pause. Then softer: "I'll be back."

The door closed. The hallway outside swallowed the sound of their footsteps, and then it was gone.

Younger sat with the quiet that followed.

The apartment breathed around them. Waiting, the way it had been waiting for three days.

Younger was the only one who could decide what to do with that.
