_True Name: Vael'shar_ (VAY-el-shar)*
_Title: The Hollow_
_Classification: Demon General — Infiltration & Assassination_
In its true form Vael'shar stands roughly eight feet, its body a shifting compression of shadow that never quite resolves into solid edges. It is not dramatically monstrous. It is wrong in a quieter way — proportions that drift slightly, a face that suggests features without having them, the impression of a figure observed through dark water. It moves without sound. It does not telegraph. When it decides to end something, that thing ends.

**Traits**
_**Shadow Form.**_ Vael'shar can move through any space as narrow as one inch without squeezing. It does not trigger pressure plates, motion sensors, or tripwires.
_**Flawless Mimicry.**_ Vael'shar can perfectly replicate the appearance, voice, scent, and surface-level mannerisms of any creature it has observed for at least 1 minute. Detecting the disguise requires a DC 28 Insight check. Truesight bypasses this automatically. Magical detection (such as _detect evil_) functions normally.
_**Premeditated.**_ Vael'shar always acts on the first round of combat, regardless of initiative. It cannot be surprised, and creatures attempting to ambush it must succeed on a DC 24 Deception check or Vael'shar is aware of the attempt before it begins.
_**Hollow Presence.**_ Creatures within 30 ft. of Vael'shar in its true form must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of their turns or become rattled — they have disadvantage on attacks against Vael'shar and cannot take reactions until the start of their next turn. Creatures that succeed are immune to this effect for 24 hours.
_**Shadow Anchor.**_ Vael'shar's shadow exists independently of light sources. It is always present and always correct — even in magical darkness, in full shadow, in featureless rooms. Creatures that observe this closely and succeed on a DC 16 Perception check notice something is wrong.
_**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).**_ If Vael'shar fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
**Actions**
_**Multiattack.**_ Vael'shar makes three Void Blade attacks. It can replace one with Hollow Touch.
_**Void Blade.** +13 to hit, reach 10 ft._ Hit: 2d10+7 slashing + 3d8 necrotic. On a hit, the target's maximum HP is reduced by the necrotic damage dealt until they complete a long rest.
_**Hollow Touch (Recharge 5–6).**_ Vael'shar reaches into a creature within 5 ft. and touches something they are afraid of losing. The target makes a DC 19 Wisdom save. On a failure: 6d10 psychic damage and the target is stunned until the end of their next turn as their worst fear plays out behind their eyes in perfect, silent detail. On a success: half damage, not stunned.
_**Unmaking Strike (1/Day).**_ One attack that is declared before the roll. On a hit: 4d12+7 piercing + 4d12 necrotic, and the target must make a DC 21 Constitution save or be reduced to 0 HP. On a miss: Vael'shar still deals 2d12+7 damage as the blade grazes.
**Bonus Actions**
_**Blink Step.**_ Vael'shar teleports up to 60 ft. to an unoccupied space it can see. It does not need line of sight — only awareness that the space exists. This does not provoke opportunity attacks.
_**Read the Room.**_ Vael'shar studies one creature within 60 ft. Until the end of its next turn, it has advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws against that creature, and that creature has disadvantage on saving throws against Vael'shar's abilities.
**Reactions**
_**Counterstrike.**_ When a creature within 10 ft. misses Vael'shar with a melee attack, Vael'shar makes one Void Blade attack against them as a reaction.
_**Phase.**_ When Vael'shar would take damage, it can use its reaction to halve that damage and teleport up to 20 ft. in any direction. It cannot Phase and Counterstrike in the same round.
**Legendary Actions** _(3/round, taken at the end of another creature's turn)_
- **Shift (1 action):** Vael'shar moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Shadow Lash (1 action):** One creature within 30 ft. makes a DC 19 Dexterity save or takes 2d8+7 necrotic damage and is knocked prone.
- **Wear Their Face (2 actions):** Vael'shar immediately assumes the appearance of one creature it can see within 60 ft. Until it uses this ability again or takes a bonus action to drop the form, it is indistinguishable from that creature to anyone without Truesight. Attacks against Vael'shar from creatures that cannot identify it as a disguise have disadvantage.
- **Full Presence (3 actions):** Vael'shar drops all pretense. Every creature within 30 ft. that can see it must make a DC 21 Wisdom save or be frightened of Vael'shar for 1 minute. Frightened creatures must use their movement to move away from Vael'shar on their turn. Creatures that succeed are immune for 24 hours.
**DM Notes (Act 1 Context)**
Vael'shar at full capacity is CR 18 — a creature that should not be fought by E-rank players. In the Act 1 encounter it is not at full engagement; it is executing a specific assignment (neutralize Michael, retrieve the Hero's Box) and treating the party as noise rather than opponents. When it strikes Emmet or Luna it is not being thorough — it is being efficient. It wants Michael's attention, not theirs.
Michael fighting it is not a fair fight. It is Michael buying time through experience, divine power, and the willingness to take damage he cannot fully absorb. The party running is the correct call. If they stay and fight, Vael'shar will demonstrate exactly why they shouldn't — precisely, without malice, the way a person swats something that landed on their arm.
Whether Vael'shar is eventually encountered again — in a different face, in a different city, wearing a form the party trusts — is entirely up to you.
