## Who He Is

**Emmet Ashford** _(EM-et ASH-ford)_ is a mid-twenties textile merchant's son from [[Stonewood]]. Cheerful, earnest, a little bumbling — but genuinely kind. He has no combat ability whatsoever and knows it.

Months before Act 1, he met [[Sera]] Voss _(SEH-rah VOSS)_ at [[Lowfield]]'s pasture market. She was on a supply run from [[Caldenveil]]; he was visiting an old family contact. They spent one afternoon together. He hasn't stopped thinking about her since.

## His Story (Act 1)

Emmet's arc across Act 1 is small in scale and enormous in weight.

**[[Beat 2 — Emmet Ashford|Beat 2]]:** He approaches the party at Stonewood's south gate, asking to travel with them to Caldenveil. He offers to pay. His stated reason is that the Twilight Forest makes the road too dangerous to walk alone. His real reason: he wants to stop inside the treeline and gather **Duskbloom** — deep violet flowers that glow faintly at night, found only in the Twilight Forest. His father once gathered them for his mother when he didn't know how else to tell her how he felt. Six kind strangers helped him. She said yes. Emmet has always loved that story. He wants to give a bundle to Sera. He knows it's a lot to ask. He asks anyway.

**[[Emmet in Lowfield|Lowfield]]:** Back in the village where he met Sera, Emmet is visibly happy in a slightly overwhelming way. He keeps stopping — the bench outside Edna's cafe, the lane, the spot where her cart was parked. If a player walks with him, he talks: the way she explained preserved goods pricing like it was fascinating, a laugh he still can't place as at him or with him. At one point he stops, looks at the pasture market, and says half to himself: *"I've never done anything brave before. In my whole life. Yesterday was the first time."* He means the forest. The flowers. The asking. He doesn't realize he's said it out loud until a beat later.

**[[Act 1 Finale — The Demon General Mimic|Act 1 Finale]] (Version A):** Just off the road, Emmet spots one final Duskbloom — the last flower he needs to complete the bundle. He doesn't wait for permission. He crosses the distance, crouches, gets the flower free without damaging it, stands, and turns back to face the party holding up the complete bundle, grinning like someone who cannot believe their own luck. He opens his mouth to say something. A pitch black blade erupts from his chest. The [[Demon General Mimic]] was behind him. Patient. Still. Waiting for exactly this. Emmet falls — but does not drop the flowers.

## Possible Outcomes

- **Saved:** Players stabilize him and get him moving within 3 rounds. Emmet survives, gravely wounded and unconscious — still clutching the flowers when they pry them from his hand.
- **Dies:** Players don't reach him in time. Emmet dies in the road with the complete bundle in his hands.
- **Not present (Version B):** If Emmet is not with the party at the finale, the Mimic takes a different form — an injured girl, emerging from the trees, pointing behind the party. The ambush targets [[Luna]] instead.
