- **Role:** Paladin, Church Champion, Former Hero's Companion
- **Affiliation:** The Church
- **Age:** Late 40s–50s (Present Phase)
**Background**
- One of the Church's greatest warriors, chosen to accompany Arthur on his journey to defeat the Demon King
- Fought alongside Arthur through the entirety of that campaign, forging a deep bond of brotherhood and mutual respect
- After Arthur's retirement, Adonis remained in the Church's service and rose to become its strongest Paladin
- When the Pope issued the decree to eliminate the Demon King's offspring, Adonis was chosen to lead the holy inquisition
- He tracked Arthur to the Evergreen Forest and led the raid that killed him — following his orders with conviction but not without cost
- Arthur's death at his hands is the wound Adonis carries quietly and alone
**Personality**
- Stern, disciplined, and unwavering in his duty
- A man of few words and absolute conviction — he does not second guess orders, but he feels their weight
- Deeply faithful to the Church and the Goddess, but the killing of Arthur has left a crack in his certainty he has never fully addressed
- Respects strength and courage above all else
- Not cruel — he takes no pleasure in violence, he simply does what must be done
**The Burden**
- Adonis does not speak of Arthur
- He executed his orders believing it was necessary to protect the world
- Whether he was right is a question he buries under duty and discipline
- If players in the Present phase push him on it, there is something underneath that hasn't healed
**Will — Stage III: Realization (Divine Wrath)**
- **Manifestation:** Raw physical force — his strikes hit harder than any man his size should
- **Awakening:** His Will is not mere strength but divine wrath — the Goddess's judgment made flesh, a force that grows more dangerous the longer a fight continues
- **Realization:** Adonis becomes the instrument of divine destruction itself — his body transcends its limits, pain and fear cease to exist, and every strike carries the weight of holy sentence

**Story Notes (DM Only)**
- Adonis is morally complex — not a villain, but the man who killed Arthur and set the entire tragedy in motion
- In the Present phase he is a potential ally against the Demon King, creating a deeply uncomfortable dynamic for players who lived through the Past phase
- His Divine Wrath Will is a thematic contrast to Arthur's Light Will — wrath vs. grace, endurance vs. precision, the soldier vs. the chosen hero
- Whether Adonis ever fully reckons with what he did to Arthur is a story thread worth pulling
