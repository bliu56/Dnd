- **Role:** Low-ranking Church Member, Unaware Hero Candidate
- **Affiliation:** The Church
- **True Name:** Raphael
- **Age:** 17–19 (Present Phase)
**Background**
- Born to a noble family that fled their house and renounced their title to live a quiet common life
- His parents' noble family never accepted their departure and has been hunting them ever since
- Grew up in a small village, living simply and far from his noble origins
- The village was destroyed by the Demon King's forces — Tristan, now fully awakened as Baal
- Raphael survived and disappeared into the chaos, adopting the name John and joining the Church as a low-ranking member
- The Church asks few questions, offers training, and puts him on a path toward the Demon King — the perfect cover
- His true goal is revenge for his village. He may also be hunting a specific demon responsible for the attack
**Personality**
- Brooding and closed off — keeps people at arm's length
- Says little, observes much
- Driven by a quiet, burning need for revenge that he rarely speaks about
- Not unfriendly, but not warm either — he tolerates people more than he welcomes them
- Beneath the walls, there is someone worth knowing — but he hasn't let anyone in yet
**Relationship with Michael**
- Genuinely respects Michael even if he doesn't show it much
- Michael's encouragement to try the box quietly irritates him — he doesn't see himself as anything special
- Deep down, Michael's belief in him is something he doesn't know what to do with
**Relationship with Luna**
- They bicker regularly — she gets under his skin more than most
- He would never admit it but her energy is something he finds grounding even when it annoys him
**Secret**
- His true name is Raphael, son of a noble family
- Someone from his noble bloodline is actively hunting him
- He joined the Church not out of faith but out of convenience and proximity to the fight against the Demon King

**Story Notes (DM Only)**
- John opening the Hero's Box is the key turning point of the Present phase — the weapon inside should feel meaningful and personal to the player
- His noble bloodline hunting him is a potential side arc or future complication
- His revenge goal puts him on a collision course with Tristan/Baal — a deeply layered confrontation given what the players will know from the Past phase
