# Michael

- **Role:** Archbishop, Mentor, Bearer of the Hero's Box
- **Affiliation:** The Church
- **Status:** Alive
**Background**
- A high-ranking Archbishop of the Church, tasked with traveling the world to find the next Hero
- Carries the Hero's Box — a magically sealed relic that can only be opened by a Hero Candidate
- Inside the box is a weapon uniquely suited to whoever opens it
- Currently traveling with Luna and John, training both as they journey from Stonewood to Lowfield
**Personality**
- Kind, patient, and warm — a natural teacher and father figure
- A wholehearted believer in the Church and its mission; his faith is genuine, not performative
- Believes deeply that anyone can be a Hero — it is not about birth or title but about heart and growth
- Consistently encourages John to try opening the box, seeing something in him that John doesn't see in himself
- Never pushy or forceful about it — he plants seeds and waits
**Relationship with John**
- Thinks of John as someone worth investing in — a low-ranking Church member he has taken under his wing
- Has no idea John is a Hero Candidate; his encouragement comes purely from his philosophy that anyone could be
- The moment John opens the box will likely be as surprising to Michael as it is to everyone else
**Relationship with Luna**
- Her direct superior and teacher
- Trusts her and values her steady presence on the road
**The Hero's Box**
- A magically sealed relic entrusted to Michael by the Church
- Glows with holy energy when a Hero Candidate touches it — they can feel it but cannot open it
- Only a true Hero Candidate can open it, revealing a weapon perfectly suited to them inside
- A Hero Candidate is not guaranteed to become a Hero — they have the potential but must still grow and prove themselves
