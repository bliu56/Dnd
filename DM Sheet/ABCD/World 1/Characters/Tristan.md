- **Role:** Child, Demon King's Offspring
- **Affiliation:** None (lives with Arthur in the Evergreen Forest)
- **True Name:** Baal
- **Age:** 12 (Past Phase)
**Background**
- The offspring of the last Demon King, taken in by Arthur as an infant
- Raised in the Evergreen Forest under the name Tristan, presented to others as Arthur's adopted orphan
- Has lived a quiet, peaceful life — training, helping Arthur, and exploring the forest
- Suspects he is not fully human given Arthur is, but has never asked and doesn't particularly care
**Personality**
- Quiet and reserved — a child of few words
- Deeply loyal to Arthur, whom he considers his father in every way that matters
- Obedient and diligent in his training
- Content with his simple life; unbothered by questions of identity or origin
**Demonic Traits**
- Appears fully human at rest — demons only reveal their nature when drawing on their power
- When using magic, demonic traits begin to emerge: horns on his forehead, wings, red markings along his body, and glowing red eyes
- The more power he draws, the more pronounced the transformation
- Possesses innate super strength and superior physiology compared to humans even without magic
- Produces his own mana internally rather than drawing from nature or gods
**Magic**
- Partially trained under Arthur's guidance — has meaningful control but is far from his true potential
- His magic is innate and self-produced, making it fundamentally different from human spellcasting
- The full scope of his power is unknown, even to himself

**Traits**
- _**Demonic Physiology.**_ Tristan's body is naturally superior to a human's. He has advantage on Strength checks and saving throws, and does not need to eat, drink, or sleep as often as a human.
- _**Innate Mana.**_ Tristan produces his own mana internally. His magic cannot be suppressed by antimagic effects that target external mana sources.
- _**Partial Transformation.**_ When Tristan uses any magic ability, his demonic traits begin to emerge (horns, wings, red markings, glowing red eyes). His AC increases by 1 and he gains 10 temporary HP when this occurs. If he uses two or more magic abilities in the same encounter, his transformation deepens — his AC increases by 2 total and he gains an additional 10 temporary HP.
- _**Suppressed Potential.**_ Tristan is not close to his true power. If reduced to 0 HP, the DM may choose to trigger an Awakening — see story notes below.
**Actions**
- _**Multiattack.**_ Tristan makes two unarmed strikes.
- _**Unarmed Strike.** +5 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d6+3 bludgeoning.
- _**Demonic Bolt.** Ranged Magic Attack, +4 to hit, range 60 ft._ Hit: 2d8+2 necrotic damage. Triggers Partial Transformation.
- _**Mana Burst.**_ Tristan releases raw demonic energy in a 10 ft. radius around himself. Each creature in the area makes a DC 13 Con save, taking 3d8 necrotic damage on a fail or half on a success. Triggers Partial Transformation.
**Reactions**
- _**Instinctive Block.**_ When hit by an attack, Tristan can reduce the damage by 1d6+3 as he instinctively braces with his demonic resilience.
**Story Notes (DM Only)**
- Tristan's true power as Baal is sealed behind grief and loss — it awakens fully upon Arthur's death, the canonical trigger described in the Original Plotline
- Upon Awakening, his transformation becomes permanent and overwhelming, and the Evergreen Forest changes color around him — a sign of the Demon King's power returning to the world
- Players in the Past phase may witness or even attempt to prevent this moment
