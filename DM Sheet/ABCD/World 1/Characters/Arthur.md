## Sword Art: Radiant Edge (5 WP)

Arthur performs his signature ten-strike sequence — a continuous, flowing technique that begins with pure swordsmanship and ascends into light itself. Each strike flows naturally into the next and must be performed in order. All attacks use +9 to hit.
_— Phase 1: The Foundation (Strikes 1–5) —_
**Strike 1 — Overhead Cut:** Arthur opens with a powerful downward strike from high guard, driving his blade straight down onto the target with his full weight behind it. Hit: 1d8+5 slashing. On a hit, the target has disadvantage on their next attack roll as they are forced to absorb or deflect the blow.
**Strike 2 — Cross Slash:** Riding the momentum of the overhead cut, Arthur pivots and drives a horizontal slash across the target's chest, exploiting the opening created. Hit: 1d8+5 slashing. On a hit, the target's AC is reduced by 1 until the end of the round.
**Strike 3 — Thrust:** Arthur redirects the cross slash into a forward lunge, driving the tip of his blade into the gap exposed by the previous two strikes. Hit: 2d6+5 piercing. On a hit, the target cannot take reactions until the start of their next turn.
**Strike 4 — Pommel Strike:** As the thrust retracts, Arthur steps inside the target's guard and reverses the blade, driving his pommel hard into the target's chin or chest. Hit: 1d6+5 bludgeoning. On a hit, the target must make a DC 17 Con save or be stunned until the end of their next turn.
**Strike 5 — Shadowstep Slash:** Using the target's staggered state, Arthur bursts around them and slashes across their back to close the first phase. He moves to any unoccupied space within 10 ft. of the target. Hit: 2d8+5 slashing, made with advantage.
_— Will ignites. The blade begins to glow. —_
**Strike 6 — Luminous Overhead Cut:** Arthur raises his blade once more, but this time light gathers along the edge as he brings it down — the force of the strike now amplified by his Will into something that can cleave through far more than flesh. Hit: 1d8+5 slashing + 3d8 radiant. On a hit, the target is outlined in light and cannot benefit from invisibility or cover until the end of Arthur's next turn.
**Strike 7 — Lightspeed Cross:** The cross slash returns, now so fast it appears to strike twice at once — a single swing that lands in two places simultaneously. Arthur makes this attack twice. Each hit: 1d8+5 slashing + 2d8 radiant.
**Strike 8 — Piercing Ray:** The thrust, now condensed into a focused beam of light that erupts from the tip of the blade upon impact, punching through anything in its path. This attack hits all creatures in a 30 ft. line behind the target. Each creature in the line makes a DC 18 Dex save, taking 4d10 radiant on a fail or half on a success. Ignores resistances.
**Strike 9 — Concussive Flash:** Arthur steps inside the guard once more, releasing a point-blank explosion of light on impact. Hit: 1d6+5 bludgeoning + 3d10 radiant. On a hit, the target must make a DC 18 Con save or be blinded and stunned until the end of their next turn.
**Strike 10 — Void Slash:** The final strike. Arthur vanishes — becoming light itself — and reappears at any point within 60 ft., delivering the finishing blow as a pure photon edge. This attack automatically hits, ignores all damage resistances and immunities, and deals 6d10 slashing + 6d10 radiant. If the target is below half HP, they must make a DC 20 Con save or drop to 0 HP.
