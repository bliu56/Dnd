_Location: The Evergreen Forest_
What happens here depends entirely on what the party did in Beats 1 through 5. This beat has no fixed script — only fixed endpoints.

## What is always true

- The inquisition comes. It cannot be stopped entirely — the Pope's decree exists, Adonis has his order, the Church's machinery does not simply halt.
- Adonis leads it. He will not be turned from the mission by words alone.
- The forest knows something is wrong before it arrives.

## What the party can change

_If they warned Arthur:_
Arthur has had time to prepare. He is not surprised. He has thought about whether to run or to stand, and whatever he decided, he decided it deliberately. The fight, if there is one, is on his terms rather than the inquisition's. This does not mean he wins — but it changes the shape of it. Arthur surviving is possible if the party is present and effective.
_If they sabotaged the route:_
The inquisition arrives delayed and fractured — some units took wrong paths, some were held up by the beasts left in place. Adonis and the core group still arrive, but they arrive without full support. The odds shift.
_If they did nothing:_
Events proceed as the Original Plotline describes. The inquisition finds Arthur and Tristan. The fight is long and devastating. Arthur uses the last of his power to teleport Tristan to safety. Arthur dies.
_If they attempt to intercept Adonis:_
Adonis will listen — briefly, genuinely — if approached by people who clearly know things they shouldn't. He is not a man who dismisses inconvenient information. But he has an order from the Pope and a faith that has structured his entire life. Changing his mind requires an extraordinary argument, evidence he cannot dismiss, or something that cracks the certainty he has built around this mission. It is possible. It is very hard.

## Running the raid

Do not over-script this. Set the pieces — Arthur, Tristan, Adonis, the inquisition, the forest — and let the players move through it. The key moments to hit regardless of outcome:
- The inquisition's arrival — the forest's reaction, the wrongness of Church soldiers moving through it
- Arthur's face when he sees Adonis — they know each other. That matters.
- The fight, whatever shape it takes
- Tristan watching

## If Arthur dies

He uses the last of what he has to get Tristan out. The teleport is not elegant — it is desperate, the magic of a man who has nothing left except one more thing to do. Tristan goes. Arthur does not follow.
The forest begins to change the moment Tristan is gone. Not immediately — gradually, like a color draining from something. The green starts going wrong at the edges.

## Point Moments (DM Only)

- Whatever the party tries in the moment — reward the attempt regardless of outcome
- Adonis after, if Arthur dies — he does not celebrate. He does not speak. He leaves.
- A player who stays in the forest after it's over and watches the color begin to change
