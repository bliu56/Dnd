_Location: Somewhere safe, far away — and the Evergreen Forest_
Tristan lands somewhere safe. Far from the forest, far from the Church, far from anyone who knows what he is. He does not know what has happened yet. He knows he was sent away. He knows his father sent him.
He waits. And then, at some point — the connection he has to Arthur, whatever a child has to the only person who raised them — something tells him. Not in words. Just in the way that certainty arrives sometimes, without evidence, without announcement.
Arthur is gone.
The grief that comes from Tristan in that moment is not something a twelve-year-old should be able to produce. It is not something a person should be able to produce. It is the grief of something that was promised a life and had it taken, expressed through power that has no upper limit and no training and nothing left to hold it back.
The Evergreen Forest, miles away, finishes changing color.
**What the party experiences:**
They are still in or near the forest when it happens. The change is not gradual anymore — it completes, fast and final, the green going to violet and black and deep bruised blue in the span of minutes. The air changes. The light changes. The animals flee.
The forest that was home to Arthur and Tristan for twenty years becomes the Twilight Forest. The same one the party walked through in Act 1. They are standing inside the moment it is made.
**Ending Act 2:**
However the raid resolved — Arthur alive or dead, Adonis confronted or not, the inquisition scattered or successful — the forest's transformation is the end of Act 2. The past has played out. What the party did in it has consequences that reach forward into Act 3.
Let the last image be the forest. Give it a moment. Then Act 2 is over.
