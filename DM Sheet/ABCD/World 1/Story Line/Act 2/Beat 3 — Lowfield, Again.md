_Location: Lowfield, Past_
Lowfield is everything it was in the Present. Edna's cafe has a line out the door. Renwick is younger and moves faster and argues cheerfully with a neighbor about whose fence is whose. The Millstone is full. The pasture market is a social event as much as a commercial one.
Benno has both rooms available. The one that will eventually be kept empty and made up with particular care is currently occupied by a traveling merchant who leaves in the morning. Nothing about it is significant yet.
Edna does not have a sketch on her wall. That moment has not happened yet.

## Arthur and Tristan's visits

If the party is in Lowfield long enough — and they should be — Arthur and Tristan come through. Word spreads the moment they're spotted on the lane: the quiet man from the forest and his boy. Aunties emerge from doorways. Edna has something ready before they reach the counter. Tristan accepts whatever is pressed into his hands with quiet contentment and says nothing to anyone. Arthur smiles and thanks people and deflects questions about himself with the easy warmth of someone who has done it so many times it no longer requires effort.
This is the first time the party sees them. Arthur is alive. He is warm and present and entirely unaware of what is coming. Tristan is twelve and looks exactly like the sketch that hasn't been drawn yet.
Let the party have this moment without interrupting it. They know. Nobody else does.

- A player's face when they first see Arthur alive
- Someone who talked to Edna in Act 1 now watching her interact with Tristan — knowing what she will eventually keep on her wall
