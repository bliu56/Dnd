_Location: Caldenveil, Past_
The party arrives in Caldenveil to find it mid-preparation. Not visibly — the city looks normal, peaceful, the kind of warm and unhurried that Stonewood used to be before the war. But if they know where to look, the signs are there: Church officials moving with purpose, closed-door meetings in the upper quarters, a subtle increase in armed escorts accompanying robed figures through the streets.
The posting finds them quickly — or they find it. A Church logistics officer named **Brennan Holt** is recruiting licensed guides and cleared escorts for what he describes as a sensitive Church security operation into the Evergreen Forest. The work is straightforward: clear the major beasts along a designated corridor so that Church personnel can move through safely. The pay is good. The paperwork is minimal. Questions about the operation's purpose are met with a pleasant, practiced non-answer.
_"We're bringing in a fugitive who's been living in the forest. The beasts are the logistical problem — that's where you come in. What happens after isn't your concern."_
He is not lying, exactly. He simply is not telling them who the fugitive is.

## Brennan Holt — NPC

- Church logistics officer, mid-thirties, efficient and impersonal
- Genuinely believes the operation is just — the Pope issued the decree, Adonis is leading it, his job is to make the path clear
- Has no idea what Arthur is or was. To him this is paperwork.
- If players push for details: _"Former resident of the forest. The Church has business with him. That's all I'm authorized to share."_
- If players ask about the child: a brief pause. _"There may be a minor involved. The Church will handle that appropriately."_ He moves on quickly.
- Not a villain. Will not become one. He is a man doing a job he has not thought hard enough about.

## What the party knows

Everything. They know the fugitive is Arthur. They know the child is Tristan. They know Adonis leads the inquisition. They know Arthur dies. They are being hired to make that easier.

## What they can do

- **Take the job** — gives them access to the raid corridor, knowledge of the inquisition's timeline and route, and proximity to events they can try to shape
- **Sabotage from inside** — take the job and do it wrong: leave beasts alive in key locations, clear the wrong paths, feed bad information back to Brennan
- **Refuse** — they lose the access but they're free to act independently. Harder to get close to Arthur without the Church's cover.
- **Use the job to warn Arthur** — take the job, learn the timeline, and get to Arthur before the inquisition does
All of these are valid. The job is a tool. What they build with it is theirs.

## Point Moments (DM Only)

- A player's reaction when Brennan says "former resident of the forest" — the moment they realize they know exactly who he means
- A player asks about the child and watches Brennan move past it
- The party's first conversation among themselves after Brennan leaves — what do they decide to do
