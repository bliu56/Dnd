_Location: The [[Evergreen Forest]] / [[Arthur]]'s House_
Getting to Arthur requires either following him from Lowfield back toward the forest or finding a reason to go into the forest directly.
Arthur is immediately warm with strangers. He invites people in without much prompting — it is simply his nature. The house is exactly what it looked like in the Present phase, but lived-in and full of light. [[Tristan]] moves around it quietly, doing whatever needs doing, watching the party with the careful assessment of a child who has learned to read people.

## Arthur in conversation

- Talks easily about the forest, about [[Tristan|Tristan,]] about Lowfieldasd
- Deflects anything about his past with practiced warmth — he has done this many times and is good at it
- If pushed seriously: _"I did something important a long time ago. I'd rather not be important anymore."_
- He does not know about the decree. He will not know until the inquisition is close.
- If the party tries to warn him: he listens. He does not dismiss it. He is a man who has seen enough of the world to take warnings seriously. What he does with the warning depends on how it's delivered and how much the party tells him.

## Tristan in conversation

- Does not speak to the party. Nods. Shakes his head. Accepts food if offered.
- Watches whoever is speaking with quiet, complete attention
- If a player makes a genuine effort to connect — sits near him, doesn't push, just exists in the same space — he may eventually acknowledge them with something small: a look, a slight shift toward them, once handing something back that they dropped without being asked
- Arthur watches this and says nothing, but something in his expression softens

## Training

Arthur trains in the cleared area outside the house every morning. If a player expresses interest, he will spar with them — not to test them, just because he enjoys it. He is not trying. He is not close to trying. He is also the most technically precise fighter any of them has encountered and this is immediately obvious.

## Point Moments (DM Only)

- The moment a player realizes Arthur genuinely does not know what's coming — and chooses what to do with that
- A player who sits with Tristan without trying to get anything from him
- A player who tells Arthur the truth, or part of it, and watches him process it
