_Location: Caldenveil / en route_
The party becomes aware — through Brennan, through Church rumor, through their own observation — that the inquisition is fully assembled and moving. Adonis has received his order. The corridor is being finalized. The operation has a date.
**Adonis — first encounter:**
The party may encounter Adonis in Caldenveil before he moves toward the forest. He is not hiding. He is a Church Paladin on official business and he carries himself accordingly — present, deliberate, completely certain of his mandate.
He is not cruel. He does not relish this. He is a man who has been given an order by the institution he has served his entire life, and he has decided that his personal feelings about Arthur are not relevant to his duty. He buries it well. Not perfectly.
If the party talks to him — as hired contractors, as travelers, as anyone — he is direct and not unkind. If they probe about the operation: _"The Church has identified a threat. I've been asked to address it."_ If they mention Arthur by name: something crosses his face, brief and controlled, and then it is gone. _"I know who he is."_ Nothing more.
**The timeline:**
The party now knows when the raid happens and the route it takes. They have a specific window. What they do with it determines Beat 6.
**Options at this point:**
- Warn Arthur with enough detail that he can prepare or flee
- Sabotage the route enough to delay or redirect the inquisition
- Attempt to intercept Adonis and change his mind
- Do the job as hired and let events proceed
- Some combination of all of the above
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player who looks at Adonis and knows he is the man who kills Arthur — and has to decide how to feel about that given that he is, right now, not a villain
- The party's planning conversation — whatever they decide to do with the window they have
