## Overview

The party arrives in the Past. The world is unrecognizable — warm, whole, nothing like the one they survived. Caldenveil is peaceful. The Evergreen Forest is green. The people they met as worn-down survivors are here young and unhurt. The party knows exactly how it ends. Nobody else does.
The decree has just been issued. The inquisition is being assembled. They have been hired to clear beasts along the raid path — officially, to help apprehend a fugitive. They know who the fugitive is. They know what apprehend means. What they do with that knowledge is entirely up to them.
