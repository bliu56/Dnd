_Type: Strange Traveler_
_Location: The road, an hour or so from Lowfield — late afternoon, long shadows through the trees_
A figure comes around a bend walking toward them. Not quickly, not slowly — at the pace of someone who has been walking for a long time and stopped counting the miles. An older woman, sixties at least, dressed in practical layered wool. She carries an overstuffed canvas pack with several rolled map tubes protruding at different angles, and she is writing in a small bound journal as she walks, pausing occasionally to glance at the treeline, make a mark, and continue.
This is **Herath Soll** _(HEH-rath SOL)_, traveling cartographer. She has been mapping this road and the surrounding woodland for three weeks, updating a regional survey she first completed fifteen years ago. The world is peaceful enough now that work like hers is possible again, and she is making the most of it.
**Herath at a glance:**
- Completely at ease on the road alone, which she has been for most of her adult life
- Sharp in a way that doesn't announce itself — she will have already noticed several things about the party before she speaks
- Has no particular interest in their destination beyond its bearing on road traffic patterns
- Has strong opinions about the quality of the waystones on this stretch (poor) and the state of the road surface past the second ford (improving)
- Carries a regional map that is probably the most accurate document of its kind currently in existence
**The encounter:**
She finishes the line she's writing before looking up. Takes in the party — Church robes, hired escorts, one civilian — makes a note. Then nods.
_"Headed for Lowfield?"_
She'll answer questions about the road freely: conditions, distances, what's been moving through. She passed a six-person escort crew heading the same direction two days ago — heavy packs, moved like fighters. She noted them in her journal as potential road traffic data. She can describe them if asked (the Ironway Company, if the party hasn't met them yet).
If players ask about the woodland they've just come through: _"Ordinary mixed oak. Nothing unusual. I mapped the interior last week — it's clean. Animals, undergrowth, a badger colony near the second marker that I gave a wide berth."_ She produces her map without prompting if the conversation warrants it, worn at the folds and dense with notation.
If players ask why she's out here alone: she gives them a look that suggests she finds this question slightly puzzling. _"It's my job."_
**What she gives the party (if they engage):**
- Accurate road conditions for the remaining stretch to Lowfield
- Confirmation that the woodland is clear — she was through it recently and saw nothing that would concern a prepared escort party
- A note in her journal about the party, if anyone thinks to ask what she wrote: _"Group of eight, Church escort, Caldenveil direction. E-rank guides. One civilian, textile coat. Moving at civilian pace."_
- If a player mentions the Evergreen Forest: a slight shift in her expression — not fear, more like professional frustration. _"I've tried to map it twice. The distances come out wrong. My compass behaves incorrectly. I've stopped attempting it."_ A pause. _"Whatever lives in there, it doesn't want to be mapped."_
**What she doesn't give them:**
Conclusions or speculation. She observes and records. What it means is someone else's problem.
**After she moves on:**
She continues without looking back, stops twice more in the distance to make notes, and disappears around a bend. She was simply there, and then wasn't.
**Achievements available:**
- _Curious_ — Ask Herath at least three questions
- _Noted_ — Ask what she wrote about the party in her journal
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player asks something Herath doesn't know the answer to — she says _"I don't know"_ with no discomfort, and means it entirely
- A player tries to tell her something about the forest interior and she immediately opens her journal
- Someone asks if she gets lonely out here, and she thinks about it genuinely before answering
- Michael's comment about knowing her — a player follows up, he deflects warmly, the player notices the deflection
