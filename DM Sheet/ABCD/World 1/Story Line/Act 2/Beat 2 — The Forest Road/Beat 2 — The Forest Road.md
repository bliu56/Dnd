_Location: The road from Caldenveil toward Lowfield_
The road from Caldenveil toward Lowfield is well-traveled and in good repair — this is peacetime, and it shows. Merchants use it regularly. The verges are clear. Waystones mark every few miles with distances carved in legible hands. The first stretch out of Caldenveil is open farmland and low hills, and after that the road enters a stretch of ordinary woodland — tall oaks, dappled light, birdsong. Nothing unusual about it. It is simply a forest road in a world that is, right now, fine.
The party has been hired to clear the route. "Clear" in this context means beasts — the woodland has the usual population of territorial animals, and the Church wants its personnel to move through without incident. It is routine work. The forest is not dangerous so much as it is occasionally inconvenient.
There are three things that happen on this road. Let the journey breathe between them.
