_Type: Social / Betrayal — Slow Burn_
_Location: A waystation about two hours into the woodland — a stone outbuilding with a cleared flat area in front, maintained by Caldenveil for traveling merchants_
Late afternoon. The waystation is already occupied when the party arrives — six people, a fire going, gear stacked neatly. One of them spots the party from fifty feet away, stands up, and waves them over with the easy confidence of someone who has already decided the situation is fine.
This is **Davo Irne** _(DAY-voh IRN)_, self-appointed voice of the **Ironway Company** — a mid-sized escort crew that works the Caldenveil–Lowfield–Stonewood circuit. Davo is broad-shouldered, loud in a way that sounds friendly, and has the specific energy of a man who is always selling something even when he doesn't appear to be.
The full company: Davo, two fighters named **Holt** and **Brek**, an archer called **Nessa**, a quiet wiry man who handles logistics and hasn't offered a name, and a young woman named **Calla** who watches the party with more genuine curiosity than any of her crewmates.
**Who they are:**
- A legitimate escort company with two years on this route — they know the road well
- Not criminals by nature. Opportunistic by habit. Peacetime means the escort business is competitive and margins are thin.
- Have been asking around in Caldenveil about the Church's new beast-clearing contract. They didn't get it. The party did.
- Have decided to do something about that — not violently, just cleverly. The plan is to tail the party through the woodland, let them do the hard clearing work, and then present themselves to the Church on arrival as the crew that "assisted with the operation." Brennan Holt is new to the region and unlikely to know the difference.
- Have already decided this. They're sharing camp to confirm how far ahead the party is in the route and what's still left to clear.
**The approach:**
Davo's welcome is warm and entirely genuine in texture. He offers food, asks where they're at on the contract, makes a knowing comment about beast-clearing work that signals he knows exactly what job they're on — _"Brennan's lot? Good posting. Boring work but the Church pays clean."_ He suggests sharing camp. Makes sense. Efficient.
He is not wrong about any of this. He is also absolutely running a play.
**Reading them:**
Players who pay attention can notice:
- DC 11 Insight on Davo: Friendly and collegial, but asking very specific questions about how much of the route is already cleared and what's left ahead.
- DC 13 Insight on the logistics man: Quiet. Not participating. Making notes on a small piece of parchment.
- DC 14 Perception: Holt and Brek have positioned themselves to see the party's map or any documents without appearing to try.
- Calla is the tell. If a player makes genuine conversation with her, she is warm and uncomplicated — she mentions she's glad they got the posting because the Ironway crew could use a rest day. She hasn't been told the full plan. She thinks this is just networking.
**The night:**
Good company, genuine food, easy conversation. Davo has road stories. Nessa is dry and funny. Holt and Brek are decent enough. The plan — which the party may or may not have pieced together — is to get whatever information they need from the party's equipment or conversation, then set off before dawn and clear any remaining beasts on the route ahead of the party, arriving at Lowfield first to claim the contract completion.
It is not dangerous. It is just deeply annoying if it works.
**The play — before dawn:**
The logistics man wakes quietly and moves toward wherever the party's documents or route notes are stored. Holt stays awake on quiet watch. Davo sleeps — he genuinely believes this is fine and wouldn't lose sleep over it even if he didn't.
If the party catches it: Davo wakes immediately when called on it, sits up, and starts negotiating before he's fully upright. He is not going to fight over this. He will offer a cut of whatever the Church pays, claim it was all a misunderstanding, or simply accept being outmaneuvered with better grace than the situation deserves. He finds people who catch him more interesting than people who don't.
If the logistics man gets what he needs: the Ironway Company is gone before first light. The party arrives at Lowfield to find Davo already there, talking to Brennan's contact, being very charming about what a thorough job they all did together.
**Resolution options:**
- **Confront them tonight:** Davo negotiates. Something can be worked out. He's reasonable when cornered.
- **Let it play out and beat them there:** If the party moves faster or takes a smarter route, they arrive first. Davo, if encountered, shrugs and buys them a drink.
- **Report them to Brennan:** Davo will contest this loudly and creatively. The outcome depends on how much evidence the party has.
- **Recruit Calla:** She didn't sign up for petty contract theft and she knows it. If offered something straightforward, she'll take it.
**NPC — Calla** _(KAL-ah)_
- Early twenties, joined the Ironway Company because she needed work
- Competent with a short sword, better at reading situations than she lets on
- Hasn't done anything she's ashamed of yet and would like to keep it that way
- If treated with genuine respect by even one player, she remembers it
- _Potential future hook:_ Can reappear in later sessions as an ally, contact, or familiar face
**Achievements available:**
- _Caught Red-Handed_ — Identify and stop the logistics man before he gets what he came for
- _Beat Them To It_ — Arrive at Lowfield first regardless of what the Ironway crew does
- _Diplomat_ — Resolve the situation without confrontation
- _One More_ — Convince Calla to stay in contact with the party
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player genuinely likes someone in the Ironway crew and has to reckon with that when the plan becomes clear
- A player notices Calla's tells and treats her differently before the plan surfaces
- Someone confronts Davo and he immediately starts negotiating — funnier and stranger than a fight
- A player lets the whole thing play out and arrives at Lowfield to find Davo already there, cheerfully charming Brennan's contact
