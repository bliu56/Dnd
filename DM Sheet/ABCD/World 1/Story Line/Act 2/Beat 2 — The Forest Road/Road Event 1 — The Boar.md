_Type: Combat — Fun & Manageable_
_Location: A wide bend in the road where an old oak has fallen across a drainage ditch, creating a natural blind_
They hear it before they see it — a heavy, irregular rustling in the undergrowth to the left, then the wet crack of something rooting through dead wood. A moment later a large boar shoulders out of the brush and stops in the middle of the road, blocking the path entirely.
It is not a monster. It is just a very large boar, doing what boars do: being enormous, being unimpressed, and currently deciding whether the group is a threat to the stretch of woodland it has decided is its territory. It has a fresh scrape along its left flank — something already annoyed it today — and its ears are flat.
This is the kind of animal that experienced travelers know to respect. It is not aggressive by nature, but it has committed to this road and it weighs as much as a draft horse.
**The Boar — Statblock:**
_Large Beast, Unaligned_
- **AC:** 11 (natural hide) | **HP:** 42 (5d10 + 15) | **Speed:** 40 ft. | **CR:** 2
- **STR** 17 (+3) | **DEX** 10 (+0) | **CON** 16 (+3) | **INT** 2 (−4) | **WIS** 7 (−2) | **CHA** 5 (−3)
- **Senses:** Passive Perception 8
**Traits**
- _**Charge.**_ If the boar moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and hits with a Tusk attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 2d6 slashing damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Str save or be knocked prone.
- _**Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).**_ If the boar takes 10 damage or fewer that would reduce it to 0 HP, it is reduced to 1 HP instead.
**Actions**
- _**Tusk.** +5 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 2d6+3 slashing.
**How to run it:**
- The boar is not immediately aggressive — it postures first, snorting and tearing up the road dirt with one tusk. Players have a full round to decide their approach before it commits.
- It can be driven off. Loud noise, fire, or a couple of solid hits will convince it this road is not worth the trouble. Players who try to scare it away rather than kill it should get to feel clever.
- If it charges, it is fast and hits hard and goes straight for whoever is in front. Relentless means the first time someone thinks they've finished it, they haven't — it scrambles back up with what Brennan's posting memo probably called "typical woodland tenacity."
- John sidesteps its charge with a neatness that suggests he has dealt with boars before. He doesn't comment on this.
- Luna immediately wants to know if it's injured, pointing out the scrape. She is correct. This is not useful information in the moment.
**What happens after:**
The road is clear. The boar retreats into the brush either dead or having decided it has better things to do. Michael crouches to look at the tracks for a moment before standing up. _"Good work. That's what we're here for."_ He says it plainly, not as praise exactly — more as acknowledgment that the job is what it is and they did it well.
If the party drove it off rather than killing it, he nods once and says nothing further. That's approval.
**Achievements available:**
- _Cleared_ — Remove the boar from the road by any means
- _No Harm Done_ — Drive the boar off without killing it
- _Not a Scratch_ — Complete the encounter with no escort target taking damage
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player immediately moves to protect the most vulnerable member of the group without being asked
- Someone gets knocked prone by the charge and their reaction to it is genuinely funny or genuinely committed
- A player tries to scare it off and it works — reward the instinct
- Luna's injury observation comes up again later and turns out to be relevant
