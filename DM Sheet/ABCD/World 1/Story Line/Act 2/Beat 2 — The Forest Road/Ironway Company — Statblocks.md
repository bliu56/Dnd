_DM Note: The Ironway crew are not killers. If a fight breaks out it is because things went badly wrong — escalating tension, a player who pushed too hard, Davo miscalculating. They will fight to protect themselves but they are not willing to die over a contract dispute. Any crew member reduced to half HP or below will disengage and attempt to flee or surrender. Davo will call it off entirely if two or more of his crew are down._
_Combat CR target: The full crew together should be a Medium-to-Hard encounter for a standard party. Running them in subgroups (Holt and Brek engage while Nessa covers, logistics man bolts, Davo stalls) makes for a more dynamic fight than a straight brawl._

## Davo Irne — Leader

_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 13 (leather armor) | **HP:** 38 (7d8 + 7) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 1
- **STR** 12 (+1) | **DEX** 14 (+2) | **CON** 12 (+1) | **INT** 14 (+2) | **WIS** 12 (+1) | **CHA** 16 (+3)
- **Saving Throws:** Dex +4, Cha +5
- **Skills:** Deception +7, Insight +3, Persuasion +7, Sleight of Hand +4

### Traits

- _**Keep Talking.**_ As a bonus action, Davo can attempt a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) check against one creature that can hear and understand him. On a success, that creature has disadvantage on its next attack roll against Davo as his words momentarily break their focus. This has no effect on creatures that are already hostile and have been in combat for more than 2 rounds — they've heard enough.
- _**Read the Room.**_ Davo has advantage on Insight checks. If he beats a creature's Deception check during conversation, he knows they are lying — he may not know the truth, but he knows.

### Actions

- _**Shortsword.** +4 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d6+2 piercing.
- _**Dagger (thrown).** +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft._ Hit: 1d4+2 piercing.

### Bonus Actions

- _**Keep Talking** (see Traits)_

### Reactions

- _**Tactical Withdrawal.**_ When a creature moves to within 5 ft. of Davo, he can move up to 10 ft. away without provoking an opportunity attack.
_Combat behavior: Davo does not want to be in this fight. He will use Keep Talking every round, stay mobile, and look for an exit. If he gets one, he takes it. He will not sacrifice himself for his crew — but he will not abandon them immediately either. He's calculating the whole time._

## Holt — Sword-and-Shield Fighter

_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 16 (chain shirt + shield) | **HP:** 45 (6d10 + 12) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 2
- **STR** 16 (+3) | **DEX** 11 (+0) | **CON** 14 (+2) | **INT** 9 (−1) | **WIS** 10 (+0) | **CHA** 9 (−1)
- **Saving Throws:** Str +5, Con +4
- **Skills:** Athletics +5, Intimidation +1

### Traits

- _**Shield Wall.**_ While Holt is within 5 ft. of Brek, both of them gain +1 to AC. This bonus is already reflected in Holt's AC above only when Brek is adjacent.
- _**Stubborn.**_ Holt has advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.

### Actions

- _**Multiattack.**_ Holt makes two Longsword attacks.
- _**Longsword.** +5 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d8+3 slashing (1d10+3 two-handed, though he rarely goes two-handed with a shield).
- _**Shield Shove.** +5 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d4+3 bludgeoning. Target makes DC 13 Str save or is pushed 5 ft. and knocked prone.

### Reactions

- _**Brace.**_ When a creature moves toward Holt, he can set his shield and gain +2 AC against that creature's first attack this turn.
_Combat behavior: Holt is straightforward — he gets between threats and holds ground. He fights alongside Brek and isn't creative about it. He'll surrender before dying; he's been in enough scrapes to know when a fight is lost._
---

## Brek — Sword-and-Shield Fighter

_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 15 (chain shirt + shield) | **HP:** 40 (5d10 + 10) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 1
- **STR** 15 (+2) | **DEX** 12 (+1) | **CON** 14 (+2) | **INT** 10 (+0) | **WIS** 11 (+0) | **CHA** 10 (+0)
- **Saving Throws:** Str +4, Con +4
- **Skills:** Athletics +4, Perception +2

### Traits

- _**Shield Wall.**_ While Brek is within 5 ft. of Holt, both of them gain +1 to AC.
- _**Second Wind (1/Short Rest).**_ As a bonus action, Brek regains 1d10+2 HP.

### Actions

- _**Multiattack.**_ Brek makes two Longsword attacks.
- _**Longsword.** +4 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d8+2 slashing.

### Reactions

- _**Cover Holt.**_ When Holt is hit by a melee attack while within 5 ft. of Brek, Brek can use his reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll (declared before the roll is made).
_Combat behavior: Brek is slightly less confident than Holt but follows his lead without question. He fights defensively, uses Second Wind the moment he's below half HP, and watches Holt's back. He'll tap out when Holt does._

## Nessa — Archer

_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 14 (leather armor + Dex) | **HP:** 32 (5d8 + 10) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 2
- **STR** 10 (+0) | **DEX** 16 (+3) | **CON** 14 (+2) | **INT** 12 (+1) | **WIS** 13 (+1) | **CHA** 10 (+0)
- **Saving Throws:** Dex +5, Wis +3
- **Skills:** Perception +5, Stealth +5, Survival +3

### Traits

- _**Sharpshooter.**_ Nessa ignores half and three-quarters cover when making ranged attacks. Her ranged attacks do not suffer disadvantage from long range.
- _**Threat Assessment.**_ At the start of combat, Nessa identifies the most dangerous-looking target. Her first attack against that target has advantage.

### Actions

- _**Multiattack.**_ Nessa makes two Longbow attacks.
- _**Longbow.** +5 to hit, range 150/600 ft._ Hit: 1d8+3 piercing.
- _**Aimed Shot (1/Turn).**_ Before making a Longbow attack, Nessa can take aim. The attack deals an additional 1d6 piercing damage on a hit, but Nessa cannot move before or after making this attack this turn.

### Bonus Actions

- _**Disengage.**_ Nessa can Disengage as a bonus action.
_Combat behavior: Nessa starts at maximum range and stays there. She targets spellcasters or whoever looks most dangerous first. She will not engage in melee willingly — if someone closes with her she disengages and repositions. She's the most dangerous member of the crew in a straight fight and knows it. She's also the most likely to slip away cleanly if things go badly._

## The Logistics Man — Unnamed

_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 13 (leather armor) | **HP:** 22 (4d8 + 4) | **Speed:** 35 ft. | **CR:** 1/2
- **STR** 10 (+0) | **DEX** 15 (+2) | **CON** 12 (+1) | **INT** 13 (+1) | **WIS** 14 (+2) | **CHA** 8 (−1)
- **Saving Throws:** Dex +4
- **Skills:** Sleight of Hand +6, Stealth +6, Perception +4, Athletics +2

### Traits

- _**Slippery.**_ The logistics man can take the Disengage action as a bonus action. He has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape grapples.
- _**Light Fingers.**_ Any Sleight of Hand check made to pick a pocket, cut a strap, or take an item unnoticed has advantage.

### Actions

- _**Shortsword.** +4 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d6+2 piercing.
- _**Dirty Trick.**_ The logistics man throws dirt, a flask of oil, or whatever is at hand at one creature within 5 ft. Target makes DC 12 Dex save or is blinded until the end of their next turn.
_Combat behavior: He runs. The moment a fight breaks out he is looking for an exit and will take it the first chance he gets. He only attacks if cornered, and if cornered he uses Dirty Trick immediately to buy himself room. He has never been anyone's idea of a fighter and he is at peace with this._

## Calla — Short Sword Fighter

_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral Good_
- **AC:** 13 (leather armor) | **HP:** 28 (5d8 + 5) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 1
- **STR** 12 (+1) | **DEX** 14 (+2) | **CON** 12 (+1) | **INT** 12 (+1) | **WIS** 13 (+1) | **CHA** 12 (+1)
- **Saving Throws:** Dex +4, Wis +3
- **Skills:** Insight +3, Perception +3, Athletics +3

### Traits

- _**Won't Start It.**_ Calla will not attack first under any circumstances. She only acts in combat if she or someone she cares about is directly attacked. If the party has treated her well, she may refuse to act at all — or actively step between her crewmates and the party.
- _**Clear Eyes.**_ Calla has advantage on Insight checks against creatures she has spoken with for at least 1 minute. She is very difficult to deceive.

### Actions

- _**Shortsword.** +4 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d6+2 piercing.
- _**Disarming Strike.**_ On a hit with her shortsword, Calla can forgo the damage to force the target to make a DC 12 Str save or drop one held item of her choice.

### Reactions

- _**Not Today.**_ If a creature within 5 ft. of Calla would be reduced to 0 HP by an attack, she can use her reaction to push that creature 5 ft. out of the way, potentially causing the attack to miss. She can use this to protect a player or a crewmate — her call.
_Combat behavior: Calla does not want to be in this fight and will make that clear. If the party treated her well during the evening, she will either sit out entirely or use Not Today to protect a player if an opportunity arises. If the party was cold or dismissive, she fights defensively alongside her crew but disengages the moment Davo calls a retreat. She is the one member of the Ironway Company who a player could realistically convince to stop mid-fight._
