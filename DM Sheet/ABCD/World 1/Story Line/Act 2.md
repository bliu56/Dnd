# Act 2 — Before the Fall

**Overview**
The party arrives in the Past. The world is unrecognizable — warm, whole, nothing like the one they survived. Caldenveil is peaceful. The Evergreen Forest is green. The people they met as worn-down survivors are here young and unhurt. The party knows exactly how it ends. Nobody else does.
The decree has just been issued. The inquisition is being assembled. They have been hired to clear beasts along the raid path — officially, to help apprehend a fugitive. They know who the fugitive is. They know what apprehend means. What they do with that knowledge is entirely up to them.

## Beat 1 — The Posting

_Location: Caldenveil, Past_
The party arrives in Caldenveil to find it mid-preparation. Not visibly — the city looks normal, peaceful, the kind of warm and unhurried that Stonewood used to be before the war. But if they know where to look, the signs are there: Church officials moving with purpose, closed-door meetings in the upper quarters, a subtle increase in armed escorts accompanying robed figures through the streets.
The posting finds them quickly — or they find it. A Church logistics officer named **Brennan Holt** is recruiting licensed guides and cleared escorts for what he describes as a sensitive Church security operation into the Evergreen Forest. The work is straightforward: clear the major beasts along a designated corridor so that Church personnel can move through safely. The pay is good. The paperwork is minimal. Questions about the operation's purpose are met with a pleasant, practiced non-answer.
_"We're bringing in a fugitive who's been living in the forest. The beasts are the logistical problem — that's where you come in. What happens after isn't your concern."_
He is not lying, exactly. He simply is not telling them who the fugitive is.
**Brennan Holt — NPC**
- Church logistics officer, mid-thirties, efficient and impersonal
- Genuinely believes the operation is just — the Pope issued the decree, Adonis is leading it, his job is to make the path clear
- Has no idea what Arthur is or was. To him this is paperwork.
- If players push for details: _"Former resident of the forest. The Church has business with him. That's all I'm authorized to share."_
- If players ask about the child: a brief pause. _"There may be a minor involved. The Church will handle that appropriately."_ He moves on quickly.
- Not a villain. Will not become one. He is a man doing a job he has not thought hard enough about.
**What the party knows:**
Everything. They know the fugitive is Arthur. They know the child is Tristan. They know Adonis leads the inquisition. They know Arthur dies. They are being hired to make that easier.
**What they can do:**
- **Take the job** — gives them access to the raid corridor, knowledge of the inquisition's timeline and route, and proximity to events they can try to shape
- **Sabotage from inside** — take the job and do it wrong: leave beasts alive in key locations, clear the wrong paths, feed bad information back to Brennan
- **Refuse** — they lose the access but they're free to act independently. Harder to get close to Arthur without the Church's cover.
- **Use the job to warn Arthur** — take the job, learn the timeline, and get to Arthur before the inquisition does
All of these are valid. The job is a tool. What they build with it is theirs.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player's reaction when Brennan says "former resident of the forest" — the moment they realize they know exactly who he means
- A player asks about the child and watches Brennan move past it
- The party's first conversation among themselves after Brennan leaves — what do they decide to do

## Beat 2 — The Forest Road

_Location: The road from Caldenveil toward Lowfield_
The road from Caldenveil toward Lowfield is well-traveled and in good repair — this is peacetime, and it shows. Merchants use it regularly. The verges are clear. Waystones mark every few miles with distances carved in legible hands. The first stretch out of Caldenveil is open farmland and low hills, and after that the road enters a stretch of ordinary woodland — tall oaks, dappled light, birdsong. Nothing unusual about it. It is simply a forest road in a world that is, right now, fine.
The party has been hired to clear the route. "Clear" in this context means beasts — the woodland has the usual population of territorial animals, and the Church wants its personnel to move through without incident. It is routine work. The forest is not dangerous so much as it is occasionally inconvenient.
There are three things that happen on this road. Let the journey breathe between them.

## Road Event 1 — The Boar

_Type: Combat — Fun & Manageable_
_Location: A wide bend in the road where an old oak has fallen across a drainage ditch, creating a natural blind_
They hear it before they see it — a heavy, irregular rustling in the undergrowth to the left, then the wet crack of something rooting through dead wood. A moment later a large boar shoulders out of the brush and stops in the middle of the road, blocking the path entirely.
It is not a monster. It is just a very large boar, doing what boars do: being enormous, being unimpressed, and currently deciding whether the group is a threat to the stretch of woodland it has decided is its territory. It has a fresh scrape along its left flank — something already annoyed it today — and its ears are flat.
This is the kind of animal that experienced travelers know to respect. It is not aggressive by nature, but it has committed to this road and it weighs as much as a draft horse.
**The Boar — Statblock:**
_Large Beast, Unaligned_
- **AC:** 11 (natural hide) | **HP:** 42 (5d10 + 15) | **Speed:** 40 ft. | **CR:** 2
- **STR** 17 (+3) | **DEX** 10 (+0) | **CON** 16 (+3) | **INT** 2 (−4) | **WIS** 7 (−2) | **CHA** 5 (−3)
- **Senses:** Passive Perception 8
**Traits**
- _**Charge.**_ If the boar moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and hits with a Tusk attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 2d6 slashing damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Str save or be knocked prone.
- _**Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).**_ If the boar takes 10 damage or fewer that would reduce it to 0 HP, it is reduced to 1 HP instead.
**Actions**
- _**Tusk.** +5 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 2d6+3 slashing.
**How to run it:**
- The boar is not immediately aggressive — it postures first, snorting and tearing up the road dirt with one tusk. Players have a full round to decide their approach before it commits.
- It can be driven off. Loud noise, fire, or a couple of solid hits will convince it this road is not worth the trouble. Players who try to scare it away rather than kill it should get to feel clever.
- If it charges, it is fast and hits hard and goes straight for whoever is in front. Relentless means the first time someone thinks they've finished it, they haven't — it scrambles back up with what Brennan's posting memo probably called "typical woodland tenacity."
- John sidesteps its charge with a neatness that suggests he has dealt with boars before. He doesn't comment on this.
- Luna immediately wants to know if it's injured, pointing out the scrape. She is correct. This is not useful information in the moment.
**What happens after:**
The road is clear. The boar retreats into the brush either dead or having decided it has better things to do. Michael crouches to look at the tracks for a moment before standing up. _"Good work. That's what we're here for."_ He says it plainly, not as praise exactly — more as acknowledgment that the job is what it is and they did it well.
If the party drove it off rather than killing it, he nods once and says nothing further. That's approval.
**Achievements available:**
- _Cleared_ — Remove the boar from the road by any means
- _No Harm Done_ — Drive the boar off without killing it
- _Not a Scratch_ — Complete the encounter with no escort target taking damage
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player immediately moves to protect the most vulnerable member of the group without being asked
- Someone gets knocked prone by the charge and their reaction to it is genuinely funny or genuinely committed
- A player tries to scare it off and it works — reward the instinct
- Luna's injury observation comes up again later and turns out to be relevant

## Road Event 2 — The Ironway Company

_Type: Social / Betrayal — Slow Burn_
_Location: A waystation about two hours into the woodland — a stone outbuilding with a cleared flat area in front, maintained by Caldenveil for traveling merchants_
Late afternoon. The waystation is already occupied when the party arrives — six people, a fire going, gear stacked neatly. One of them spots the party from fifty feet away, stands up, and waves them over with the easy confidence of someone who has already decided the situation is fine.
This is **Davo Irne** _(DAY-voh IRN)_, self-appointed voice of the **Ironway Company** — a mid-sized escort crew that works the Caldenveil–Lowfield–Stonewood circuit. Davo is broad-shouldered, loud in a way that sounds friendly, and has the specific energy of a man who is always selling something even when he doesn't appear to be.
The full company: Davo, two fighters named **Holt** and **Brek**, an archer called **Nessa**, a quiet wiry man who handles logistics and hasn't offered a name, and a young woman named **Calla** who watches the party with more genuine curiosity than any of her crewmates.
**Who they are:**
- A legitimate escort company with two years on this route — they know the road well
- Not criminals by nature. Opportunistic by habit. Peacetime means the escort business is competitive and margins are thin.
- Have been asking around in Caldenveil about the Church's new beast-clearing contract. They didn't get it. The party did.
- Have decided to do something about that — not violently, just cleverly. The plan is to tail the party through the woodland, let them do the hard clearing work, and then present themselves to the Church on arrival as the crew that "assisted with the operation." Brennan Holt is new to the region and unlikely to know the difference.
- Have already decided this. They're sharing camp to confirm how far ahead the party is in the route and what's still left to clear.
**The approach:**
Davo's welcome is warm and entirely genuine in texture. He offers food, asks where they're at on the contract, makes a knowing comment about beast-clearing work that signals he knows exactly what job they're on — _"Brennan's lot? Good posting. Boring work but the Church pays clean."_ He suggests sharing camp. Makes sense. Efficient.
He is not wrong about any of this. He is also absolutely running a play.
**Reading them:**
Players who pay attention can notice:
- DC 11 Insight on Davo: Friendly and collegial, but asking very specific questions about how much of the route is already cleared and what's left ahead.
- DC 13 Insight on the logistics man: Quiet. Not participating. Making notes on a small piece of parchment.
- DC 14 Perception: Holt and Brek have positioned themselves to see the party's map or any documents without appearing to try.
- Calla is the tell. If a player makes genuine conversation with her, she is warm and uncomplicated — she mentions she's glad they got the posting because the Ironway crew could use a rest day. She hasn't been told the full plan. She thinks this is just networking.
**The night:**
Good company, genuine food, easy conversation. Davo has road stories. Nessa is dry and funny. Holt and Brek are decent enough. The plan — which the party may or may not have pieced together — is to get whatever information they need from the party's equipment or conversation, then set off before dawn and clear any remaining beasts on the route ahead of the party, arriving at Lowfield first to claim the contract completion.
It is not dangerous. It is just deeply annoying if it works.
**The play — before dawn:**
The logistics man wakes quietly and moves toward wherever the party's documents or route notes are stored. Holt stays awake on quiet watch. Davo sleeps — he genuinely believes this is fine and wouldn't lose sleep over it even if he didn't.
If the party catches it: Davo wakes immediately when called on it, sits up, and starts negotiating before he's fully upright. He is not going to fight over this. He will offer a cut of whatever the Church pays, claim it was all a misunderstanding, or simply accept being outmaneuvered with better grace than the situation deserves. He finds people who catch him more interesting than people who don't.
If the logistics man gets what he needs: the Ironway Company is gone before first light. The party arrives at Lowfield to find Davo already there, talking to Brennan's contact, being very charming about what a thorough job they all did together.
**Resolution options:**
- **Confront them tonight:** Davo negotiates. Something can be worked out. He's reasonable when cornered.
- **Let it play out and beat them there:** If the party moves faster or takes a smarter route, they arrive first. Davo, if encountered, shrugs and buys them a drink.
- **Report them to Brennan:** Davo will contest this loudly and creatively. The outcome depends on how much evidence the party has.
- **Recruit Calla:** She didn't sign up for petty contract theft and she knows it. If offered something straightforward, she'll take it.
**NPC — Calla** _(KAL-ah)_
- Early twenties, joined the Ironway Company because she needed work
- Competent with a short sword, better at reading situations than she lets on
- Hasn't done anything she's ashamed of yet and would like to keep it that way
- If treated with genuine respect by even one player, she remembers it
- _Potential future hook:_ Can reappear in later sessions as an ally, contact, or familiar face
**Achievements available:**
- _Caught Red-Handed_ — Identify and stop the logistics man before he gets what he came for
- _Beat Them To It_ — Arrive at Lowfield first regardless of what the Ironway crew does
- _Diplomat_ — Resolve the situation without confrontation
- _One More_ — Convince Calla to stay in contact with the party
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player genuinely likes someone in the Ironway crew and has to reckon with that when the plan becomes clear
- A player notices Calla's tells and treats her differently before the plan surfaces
- Someone confronts Davo and he immediately starts negotiating — funnier and stranger than a fight
- A player lets the whole thing play out and arrives at Lowfield to find Davo already there, cheerfully charming Brennan's contact

## Ironway Company — Statblocks (If Combat Starts)

_DM Note: The Ironway crew are not killers. If a fight breaks out it is because things went badly wrong — escalating tension, a player who pushed too hard, Davo miscalculating. They will fight to protect themselves but they are not willing to die over a contract dispute. Any crew member reduced to half HP or below will disengage and attempt to flee or surrender. Davo will call it off entirely if two or more of his crew are down._
_Combat CR target: The full crew together should be a Medium-to-Hard encounter for a standard party. Running them in subgroups (Holt and Brek engage while Nessa covers, logistics man bolts, Davo stalls) makes for a more dynamic fight than a straight brawl._
**Davo Irne** — _Leader_
_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 13 (leather armor) | **HP:** 38 (7d8 + 7) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 1
- **STR** 12 (+1) | **DEX** 14 (+2) | **CON** 12 (+1) | **INT** 14 (+2) | **WIS** 12 (+1) | **CHA** 16 (+3)
- **Saving Throws:** Dex +4, Cha +5
- **Skills:** Deception +7, Insight +3, Persuasion +7, Sleight of Hand +4
**Traits**
- _**Keep Talking.**_ As a bonus action, Davo can attempt a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) check against one creature that can hear and understand him. On a success, that creature has disadvantage on its next attack roll against Davo as his words momentarily break their focus. This has no effect on creatures that are already hostile and have been in combat for more than 2 rounds — they've heard enough.
- _**Read the Room.**_ Davo has advantage on Insight checks. If he beats a creature's Deception check during conversation, he knows they are lying — he may not know the truth, but he knows.
**Actions**
- _**Shortsword.** +4 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d6+2 piercing.
- _**Dagger (thrown).** +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft._ Hit: 1d4+2 piercing.
**Bonus Actions**
- _**Keep Talking** (see Traits)_
**Reactions**
- _**Tactical Withdrawal.**_ When a creature moves to within 5 ft. of Davo, he can move up to 10 ft. away without provoking an opportunity attack.
_Combat behavior: Davo does not want to be in this fight. He will use Keep Talking every round, stay mobile, and look for an exit. If he gets one, he takes it. He will not sacrifice himself for his crew — but he will not abandon them immediately either. He's calculating the whole time._
**Holt** — _Sword-and-Shield Fighter_
_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 16 (chain shirt + shield) | **HP:** 45 (6d10 + 12) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 2
- **STR** 16 (+3) | **DEX** 11 (+0) | **CON** 14 (+2) | **INT** 9 (−1) | **WIS** 10 (+0) | **CHA** 9 (−1)
- **Saving Throws:** Str +5, Con +4
- **Skills:** Athletics +5, Intimidation +1
**Traits**
- _**Shield Wall.**_ While Holt is within 5 ft. of Brek, both of them gain +1 to AC. This bonus is already reflected in Holt's AC above only when Brek is adjacent.
- _**Stubborn.**_ Holt has advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
**Actions**
- _**Multiattack.**_ Holt makes two Longsword attacks.
- _**Longsword.** +5 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d8+3 slashing (1d10+3 two-handed, though he rarely goes two-handed with a shield).
- _**Shield Shove.** +5 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d4+3 bludgeoning. Target makes DC 13 Str save or is pushed 5 ft. and knocked prone.
**Reactions**
- _**Brace.**_ When a creature moves toward Holt, he can set his shield and gain +2 AC against that creature's first attack this turn.
_Combat behavior: Holt is straightforward — he gets between threats and holds ground. He fights alongside Brek and isn't creative about it. He'll surrender before dying; he's been in enough scrapes to know when a fight is lost._
**Brek** — _Sword-and-Shield Fighter_
_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 15 (chain shirt + shield) | **HP:** 40 (5d10 + 10) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 1
- **STR** 15 (+2) | **DEX** 12 (+1) | **CON** 14 (+2) | **INT** 10 (+0) | **WIS** 11 (+0) | **CHA** 10 (+0)
- **Saving Throws:** Str +4, Con +4
- **Skills:** Athletics +4, Perception +2
**Traits**
- _**Shield Wall.**_ While Brek is within 5 ft. of Holt, both of them gain +1 to AC.
- _**Second Wind (1/Short Rest).**_ As a bonus action, Brek regains 1d10+2 HP.
**Actions**
- _**Multiattack.**_ Brek makes two Longsword attacks.
- _**Longsword.** +4 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d8+2 slashing.
**Reactions**
- _**Cover Holt.**_ When Holt is hit by a melee attack while within 5 ft. of Brek, Brek can use his reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll (declared before the roll is made).
_Combat behavior: Brek is slightly less confident than Holt but follows his lead without question. He fights defensively, uses Second Wind the moment he's below half HP, and watches Holt's back. He'll tap out when Holt does._
**Nessa** — _Archer_
_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 14 (leather armor + Dex) | **HP:** 32 (5d8 + 10) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 2
- **STR** 10 (+0) | **DEX** 16 (+3) | **CON** 14 (+2) | **INT** 12 (+1) | **WIS** 13 (+1) | **CHA** 10 (+0)
- **Saving Throws:** Dex +5, Wis +3
- **Skills:** Perception +5, Stealth +5, Survival +3
**Traits**
- _**Sharpshooter.**_ Nessa ignores half and three-quarters cover when making ranged attacks. Her ranged attacks do not suffer disadvantage from long range.
- _**Threat Assessment.**_ At the start of combat, Nessa identifies the most dangerous-looking target. Her first attack against that target has advantage.
**Actions**
- _**Multiattack.**_ Nessa makes two Longbow attacks.
- _**Longbow.** +5 to hit, range 150/600 ft._ Hit: 1d8+3 piercing.
- _**Aimed Shot (1/Turn).**_ Before making a Longbow attack, Nessa can take aim. The attack deals an additional 1d6 piercing damage on a hit, but Nessa cannot move before or after making this attack this turn.
**Bonus Actions**
- _**Disengage.**_ Nessa can Disengage as a bonus action.
_Combat behavior: Nessa starts at maximum range and stays there. She targets spellcasters or whoever looks most dangerous first. She will not engage in melee willingly — if someone closes with her she disengages and repositions. She's the most dangerous member of the crew in a straight fight and knows it. She's also the most likely to slip away cleanly if things go badly._
**The Logistics Man** — _Unnamed_
_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 13 (leather armor) | **HP:** 22 (4d8 + 4) | **Speed:** 35 ft. | **CR:** 1/2
- **STR** 10 (+0) | **DEX** 15 (+2) | **CON** 12 (+1) | **INT** 13 (+1) | **WIS** 14 (+2) | **CHA** 8 (−1)
- **Saving Throws:** Dex +4
- **Skills:** Sleight of Hand +6, Stealth +6, Perception +4, Athletics +2
**Traits**
- _**Slippery.**_ The logistics man can take the Disengage action as a bonus action. He has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape grapples.
- _**Light Fingers.**_ Any Sleight of Hand check made to pick a pocket, cut a strap, or take an item unnoticed has advantage.
**Actions**
- _**Shortsword.** +4 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d6+2 piercing.
- _**Dirty Trick.**_ The logistics man throws dirt, a flask of oil, or whatever is at hand at one creature within 5 ft. Target makes DC 12 Dex save or is blinded until the end of their next turn.
_Combat behavior: He runs. The moment a fight breaks out he is looking for an exit and will take it the first chance he gets. He only attacks if cornered, and if cornered he uses Dirty Trick immediately to buy himself room. He has never been anyone's idea of a fighter and he is at peace with this._
**Calla** — _Short Sword Fighter_
_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral Good_
- **AC:** 13 (leather armor) | **HP:** 28 (5d8 + 5) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 1
- **STR** 12 (+1) | **DEX** 14 (+2) | **CON** 12 (+1) | **INT** 12 (+1) | **WIS** 13 (+1) | **CHA** 12 (+1)
- **Saving Throws:** Dex +4, Wis +3
- **Skills:** Insight +3, Perception +3, Athletics +3
**Traits**
- _**Won't Start It.**_ Calla will not attack first under any circumstances. She only acts in combat if she or someone she cares about is directly attacked. If the party has treated her well, she may refuse to act at all — or actively step between her crewmates and the party.
- _**Clear Eyes.**_ Calla has advantage on Insight checks against creatures she has spoken with for at least 1 minute. She is very difficult to deceive.
**Actions**
- _**Shortsword.** +4 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d6+2 piercing.
- _**Disarming Strike.**_ On a hit with her shortsword, Calla can forgo the damage to force the target to make a DC 12 Str save or drop one held item of her choice.
**Reactions**
- _**Not Today.**_ If a creature within 5 ft. of Calla would be reduced to 0 HP by an attack, she can use her reaction to push that creature 5 ft. out of the way, potentially causing the attack to miss. She can use this to protect a player or a crewmate — her call.
_Combat behavior: Calla does not want to be in this fight and will make that clear. If the party treated her well during the evening, she will either sit out entirely or use Not Today to protect a player if an opportunity arises. If the party was cold or dismissive, she fights defensively alongside her crew but disengages the moment Davo calls a retreat. She is the one member of the Ironway Company who a player could realistically convince to stop mid-fight._

## Road Event 3 — The Cartographer

_Type: Strange Traveler_
_Location: The road, an hour or so from Lowfield — late afternoon, long shadows through the trees_
A figure comes around a bend walking toward them. Not quickly, not slowly — at the pace of someone who has been walking for a long time and stopped counting the miles. An older woman, sixties at least, dressed in practical layered wool. She carries an overstuffed canvas pack with several rolled map tubes protruding at different angles, and she is writing in a small bound journal as she walks, pausing occasionally to glance at the treeline, make a mark, and continue.
This is **Herath Soll** _(HEH-rath SOL)_, traveling cartographer. She has been mapping this road and the surrounding woodland for three weeks, updating a regional survey she first completed fifteen years ago. The world is peaceful enough now that work like hers is possible again, and she is making the most of it.
**Herath at a glance:**
- Completely at ease on the road alone, which she has been for most of her adult life
- Sharp in a way that doesn't announce itself — she will have already noticed several things about the party before she speaks
- Has no particular interest in their destination beyond its bearing on road traffic patterns
- Has strong opinions about the quality of the waystones on this stretch (poor) and the state of the road surface past the second ford (improving)
- Carries a regional map that is probably the most accurate document of its kind currently in existence
**The encounter:**
She finishes the line she's writing before looking up. Takes in the party — Church robes, hired escorts, one civilian — makes a note. Then nods.
_"Headed for Lowfield?"_
She'll answer questions about the road freely: conditions, distances, what's been moving through. She passed a six-person escort crew heading the same direction two days ago — heavy packs, moved like fighters. She noted them in her journal as potential road traffic data. She can describe them if asked (the Ironway Company, if the party hasn't met them yet).
If players ask about the woodland they've just come through: _"Ordinary mixed oak. Nothing unusual. I mapped the interior last week — it's clean. Animals, undergrowth, a badger colony near the second marker that I gave a wide berth."_ She produces her map without prompting if the conversation warrants it, worn at the folds and dense with notation.
If players ask why she's out here alone: she gives them a look that suggests she finds this question slightly puzzling. _"It's my job."_
**What she gives the party (if they engage):**
- Accurate road conditions for the remaining stretch to Lowfield
- Confirmation that the woodland is clear — she was through it recently and saw nothing that would concern a prepared escort party
- A note in her journal about the party, if anyone thinks to ask what she wrote: _"Group of eight, Church escort, Caldenveil direction. E-rank guides. One civilian, textile coat. Moving at civilian pace."_
- If a player mentions the Evergreen Forest: a slight shift in her expression — not fear, more like professional frustration. _"I've tried to map it twice. The distances come out wrong. My compass behaves incorrectly. I've stopped attempting it."_ A pause. _"Whatever lives in there, it doesn't want to be mapped."_
**What she doesn't give them:**
Conclusions or speculation. She observes and records. What it means is someone else's problem.
**After she moves on:**
She continues without looking back, stops twice more in the distance to make notes, and disappears around a bend. She was simply there, and then wasn't.
**Achievements available:**
- _Curious_ — Ask Herath at least three questions
- _Noted_ — Ask what she wrote about the party in her journal
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player asks something Herath doesn't know the answer to — she says _"I don't know"_ with no discomfort, and means it entirely
- A player tries to tell her something about the forest interior and she immediately opens her journal
- Someone asks if she gets lonely out here, and she thinks about it genuinely before answering
- Michael's comment about knowing her — a player follows up, he deflects warmly, the player notices the deflection

## Beat 3 — Lowfield, Again?

_Location: Lowfield, Past_
Lowfield is everything it was in the Present. Edna's cafe has a line out the door. Renwick is younger and moves faster and argues cheerfully with a neighbor about whose fence is whose. The Millstone is full. The pasture market is a social event as much as a commercial one.
Benno has both rooms available. The one that will eventually be kept empty and made up with particular care is currently occupied by a traveling merchant who leaves in the morning. Nothing about it is significant yet.
Edna does not have a sketch on her wall. That moment has not happened yet.
**Arthur and Tristan's visits:**
If the party is in Lowfield long enough — and they should be — Arthur and Tristan come through. Word spreads the moment they're spotted on the lane: the quiet man from the forest and his boy. Aunties emerge from doorways. Edna has something ready before they reach the counter. Tristan accepts whatever is pressed into his hands with quiet contentment and says nothing to anyone. Arthur smiles and thanks people and deflects questions about himself with the easy warmth of someone who has done it so many times it no longer requires effort.
This is the first time the party sees them. Arthur is alive. He is warm and present and entirely unaware of what is coming. Tristan is twelve and looks exactly like the sketch that hasn't been drawn yet.
Let the party have this moment without interrupting it. They know. Nobody else does.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player's face when they first see Arthur alive
- Someone who talked to Edna in Act 1 now watching her interact with Tristan — knowing what she will eventually keep on her wall

## Beat 4 — Arthur and Tristan

_Location: The Evergreen Forest / Arthur's House_
Getting to Arthur requires either following him from Lowfield back toward the forest or finding a reason to go into the forest directly.
Arthur is immediately warm with strangers. He invites people in without much prompting — it is simply his nature. The house is exactly what it looked like in the Present phase, but lived-in and full of light. Tristan moves around it quietly, doing whatever needs doing, watching the party with the careful assessment of a child who has learned to read people.
**Arthur in conversation:**
- Talks easily about the forest, about Tristan, about Lowfield
- Deflects anything about his past with practiced warmth — he has done this many times and is good at it
- If pushed seriously: _"I did something important a long time ago. I'd rather not be important anymore."_
- He does not know about the decree. He will not know until the inquisition is close.
- If the party tries to warn him: he listens. He does not dismiss it. He is a man who has seen enough of the world to take warnings seriously. What he does with the warning depends on how it's delivered and how much the party tells him.
**Tristan in conversation:**
- Does not speak to the party. Nods. Shakes his head. Accepts food if offered.
- Watches whoever is speaking with quiet, complete attention
- If a player makes a genuine effort to connect — sits near him, doesn't push, just exists in the same space — he may eventually acknowledge them with something small: a look, a slight shift toward them, once handing something back that they dropped without being asked
- Arthur watches this and says nothing, but something in his expression softens
**Training:**
Arthur trains in the cleared area outside the house every morning. If a player expresses interest, he will spar with them — not to test them, just because he enjoys it. He is not trying. He is not close to trying. He is also the most technically precise fighter any of them has encountered and this is immediately obvious.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- The moment a player realizes Arthur genuinely does not know what's coming — and chooses what to do with that
- A player who sits with Tristan without trying to get anything from him
- A player who tells Arthur the truth, or part of it, and watches him process it

## Beat 5 — The Inquisition Assembles

_Location: Caldenveil / en route_
The party becomes aware — through Brennan, through Church rumor, through their own observation — that the inquisition is fully assembled and moving. Adonis has received his order. The corridor is being finalized. The operation has a date.
**Adonis — first encounter:**
The party may encounter Adonis in Caldenveil before he moves toward the forest. He is not hiding. He is a Church Paladin on official business and he carries himself accordingly — present, deliberate, completely certain of his mandate.
He is not cruel. He does not relish this. He is a man who has been given an order by the institution he has served his entire life, and he has decided that his personal feelings about Arthur are not relevant to his duty. He buries it well. Not perfectly.
If the party talks to him — as hired contractors, as travelers, as anyone — he is direct and not unkind. If they probe about the operation: _"The Church has identified a threat. I've been asked to address it."_ If they mention Arthur by name: something crosses his face, brief and controlled, and then it is gone. _"I know who he is."_ Nothing more.
**The timeline:**
The party now knows when the raid happens and the route it takes. They have a specific window. What they do with it determines Beat 6.
**Options at this point:**
- Warn Arthur with enough detail that he can prepare or flee
- Sabotage the route enough to delay or redirect the inquisition
- Attempt to intercept Adonis and change his mind
- Do the job as hired and let events proceed
- Some combination of all of the above
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player who looks at Adonis and knows he is the man who kills Arthur — and has to decide how to feel about that given that he is, right now, not a villain
- The party's planning conversation — whatever they decide to do with the window they have

## Beat 6 — The Raid

_Location: The Evergreen Forest_
What happens here depends entirely on what the party did in Beats 1 through 5. This beat has no fixed script — only fixed endpoints.
**What is always true:**
- The inquisition comes. It cannot be stopped entirely — the Pope's decree exists, Adonis has his order, the Church's machinery does not simply halt.
- Adonis leads it. He will not be turned from the mission by words alone.
- The forest knows something is wrong before it arrives.
**What the party can change:**
_If they warned Arthur:_
Arthur has had time to prepare. He is not surprised. He has thought about whether to run or to stand, and whatever he decided, he decided it deliberately. The fight, if there is one, is on his terms rather than the inquisition's. This does not mean he wins — but it changes the shape of it. Arthur surviving is possible if the party is present and effective.
_If they sabotaged the route:_
The inquisition arrives delayed and fractured — some units took wrong paths, some were held up by the beasts left in place. Adonis and the core group still arrive, but they arrive without full support. The odds shift.
_If they did nothing:_
Events proceed as the Original Plotline describes. The inquisition finds Arthur and Tristan. The fight is long and devastating. Arthur uses the last of his power to teleport Tristan to safety. Arthur dies.
_If they attempt to intercept Adonis:_
Adonis will listen — briefly, genuinely — if approached by people who clearly know things they shouldn't. He is not a man who dismisses inconvenient information. But he has an order from the Pope and a faith that has structured his entire life. Changing his mind requires an extraordinary argument, evidence he cannot dismiss, or something that cracks the certainty he has built around this mission. It is possible. It is very hard.
**Running the raid:**
Do not over-script this. Set the pieces — Arthur, Tristan, Adonis, the inquisition, the forest — and let the players move through it. The key moments to hit regardless of outcome:
- The inquisition's arrival — the forest's reaction, the wrongness of Church soldiers moving through it
- Arthur's face when he sees Adonis — they know each other. That matters.
- The fight, whatever shape it takes
- Tristan watching
**If Arthur dies:**
He uses the last of what he has to get Tristan out. The teleport is not elegant — it is desperate, the magic of a man who has nothing left except one more thing to do. Tristan goes. Arthur does not follow.
The forest begins to change the moment Tristan is gone. Not immediately — gradually, like a color draining from something. The green starts going wrong at the edges.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- Whatever the party tries in the moment — reward the attempt regardless of outcome
- Adonis after, if Arthur dies — he does not celebrate. He does not speak. He leaves.
- A player who stays in the forest after it's over and watches the color begin to change

## Beat 7 — Tristan's Awakening

_Location: Somewhere safe, far away — and the Evergreen Forest_
Tristan lands somewhere safe. Far from the forest, far from the Church, far from anyone who knows what he is. He does not know what has happened yet. He knows he was sent away. He knows his father sent him.
He waits. And then, at some point — the connection he has to Arthur, whatever a child has to the only person who raised them — something tells him. Not in words. Just in the way that certainty arrives sometimes, without evidence, without announcement.
Arthur is gone.
The grief that comes from Tristan in that moment is not something a twelve-year-old should be able to produce. It is not something a person should be able to produce. It is the grief of something that was promised a life and had it taken, expressed through power that has no upper limit and no training and nothing left to hold it back.
The Evergreen Forest, miles away, finishes changing color.
**What the party experiences:**
They are still in or near the forest when it happens. The change is not gradual anymore — it completes, fast and final, the green going to violet and black and deep bruised blue in the span of minutes. The air changes. The light changes. The animals flee.
The forest that was home to Arthur and Tristan for twenty years becomes the Twilight Forest. The same one the party walked through in Act 1. They are standing inside the moment it is made.
**Ending Act 2:**
However the raid resolved — Arthur alive or dead, Adonis confronted or not, the inquisition scattered or successful — the forest's transformation is the end of Act 2. The past has played out. What the party did in it has consequences that reach forward into Act 3.
Let the last image be the forest. Give it a moment. Then Act 2 is over.
**Achievements available across Act 2:**
- _Working Against It_ — Sabotage the raid corridor from inside the operation
- _Tell Him_ — Warn Arthur about the inquisition
- _Move Him_ — Successfully convince Adonis to hesitate or reconsider
- _He's Still Here_ — Keep Arthur alive through the raid
- _The Forest Remembers_ — Be present when the Evergreen Forest becomes the Twilight Forest
- _Sit With Him_ — Connect with Tristan without pushing
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- Any player who carries the weight of knowing through the whole act — who plays their character as someone who knows how it ends and chooses anyway
- The party's conversation after the forest changes — what they say to each other when it's over
- Anyone who looks back at the house before leaving the forest for the last time
