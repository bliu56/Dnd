_Type: Ambush / Forced Retreat — End of Act 1_
After leaving Lowfield the road changes. The Twilight Forest is behind them. The unnamed forest between here and Caldenveil is ordinary — quiet, green, light behaving as light should. The mood lifts. The worst of the journey is over. Caldenveil is ahead. Let this breathe for a moment. The party needs to feel safe before it stops being safe.
