The road is quiet. Ordinary forest on both sides. Then a girl emerges from the trees ahead — young, maybe fifteen, clearly injured, clutching her arm and moving unevenly. She looks at the party like someone who has been running for a very long time.
She points — not forward, but behind the party. Back the way they came.
_"There are monsters. Back there. In the trees. They're coming."_
Then she collapses.

## The inconsistency

The party came from that direction. They saw nothing. Players who stop to think — why is she pointing behind them, why did they not encounter anything from that direction, why did she emerge from the opposite side of the road — can make a DC 13 Insight or Perception check to register that something is wrong.
If nobody flags it, Luna is already moving. She is crouching beside the girl, hands glowing with healing light, before anyone has finished processing the scene. It is exactly what Luna does. It is not a mistake — it is who she is.
As the light reaches the girl, her hand shifts. The fingers elongate, darken, fuse — and a pitch black blade drives up into Luna's side.
Luna makes no sound. She just — stops. And then lists sideways.

## Luna's condition

Incapacitated. Breathing, but cannot cast, cannot move under her own power, will not stabilize without immediate healing from another source. She needs to be carried. Every round she goes without healing, her condition worsens.
The Mimic drops the disguise. What stands up is vast and wrong and has been patient for a long time
