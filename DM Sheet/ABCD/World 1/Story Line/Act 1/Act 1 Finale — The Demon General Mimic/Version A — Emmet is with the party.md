The road is easy and the conversation is good. Emmet has been walking with more confidence than he has shown all trip — there's an energy to him that wasn't there in the Twilight Forest, something lighter. He keeps touching the inside of his coat where the Duskbloom are wrapped.
Then he sees it. Just off the path, close enough to reach in under a minute — one final Duskbloom, growing alone at the base of a tree. The last one he needs to complete the bundle.
He looks at the party. He looks at the flower. He looks at the party again.
_"It's right there. I'll just — one second. I'll be right back."_
He doesn't wait for permission. He crosses the short distance with the slightly undignified speed of someone trying to look casual while doing something they're excited about. He crouches. Gets the flower free without damaging it. Stands.
He turns around to face the party. He holds the flower up. He has the complete bundle in his other hand. He is grinning — genuinely, fully, the expression of someone who cannot believe their own luck and is not trying to hide it. He opens his mouth to say something —
A pitch black blade erupts from his chest.
It came from directly behind him. From a shadow that was not there a moment ago. The Demon General Mimic has been there the entire time — patient, still, waiting for exactly this: a turned back, a moment of joy, a split second of absolute inattention.
Emmet looks down at the blade. He is still holding the flowers. He does not drop them.
The Mimic withdraws the blade and steps back. Emmet falls.

## Saving Emmet

He is alive but will not be for long without help. A player must reach him, stabilize him, and get him moving — at minimum one action to stabilize and someone to support his weight. Luna can assist if players are moving rather than fighting.
- Stabilized and carried within 3 rounds: Emmet survives, gravely wounded, unconscious — still holding the flowers when they pry them from his hand
- Not reached in time: Emmet dies in the road with the complete bundle in his hands
