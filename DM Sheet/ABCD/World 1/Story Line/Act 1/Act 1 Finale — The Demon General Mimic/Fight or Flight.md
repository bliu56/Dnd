_The moment after Vael'shar reveals itself and Michael steps forward_
The party has three options: rescue the wounded, stay and fight, or run. Michael's order is to run. What the party does is up to them — but every path eventually leads to the same place: cornered, outmatched, and John holding a box that has never opened for anyone.

### Option 1 — Rescue

The party's priority is getting to Emmet or Luna before worrying about anything else. This is largely player-driven — how they move, who covers who, whether they succeed in time. Wing this based on the table.
The key tension: every round spent on rescue is a round not running. Vael'shar is occupied with Michael, but Michael will not hold indefinitely. The rescue window is real but it is closing.
Once the wounded are stabilized and moving, the party is still in the same situation — they need to run, and Vael'shar will eventually be behind them.

### Option 2 — Stay and Fight

They can try. Vael'shar will let them try for exactly long enough to make the point.
The first player to attack gets a response — one strike, precise and contemptuous, that deals enough damage to make the gap in capability undeniable. Vael'shar does not follow up. It returns its attention to Michael as if the player has already been accounted for.
If the party persists: Michael will not say it again. He said run. Whether they listened is on them. Eventually, when Michael goes down or the damage becomes untenable, the party will run anyway — just worse off than if they had gone immediately.
Wing the specifics. The point is not to kill players, it is to make the correct decision obvious in hindsight.

### Option 3 — Run

The party can run in two directions: toward Caldenveil, or back toward Lowfield. Both paths lead to the same outcome — Michael is killed — but they play out differently.

## Running toward Caldenveil

The party moves fast. The sounds of the fight behind them are enormous and then, at a point they can't precisely identify, stop. Not a conclusion. Just silence.
Vael'shar is not immediately behind them — but it will be. It finishes what it came for first. The party has a window: keep running, or hide.
- _Keep running:_ They may reach Caldenveil's gates before Vael'shar catches up. The gates, the guards, the city — these change the calculation for Vael'shar. It is not gone, but it chooses not to follow into a populated, defensible location. For now.
- _Hide:_ DC 18 Stealth as a group. On a success, Vael'shar passes by — they can hear it moving, feel the wrongness of its presence in the air, and then it is gone. On a failure, it finds them.

## Running toward Lowfield

Vael'shar does not follow toward Lowfield. The party does not know why. It kills Michael, and then it simply does not pursue in that direction. The forest road back to the village is clear.
_DM Note: Vael'shar knows what Lowfield is. It knows who protects it. It will not go there._
In either direction, if Vael'shar catches up before the party reaches safety, it is not immediately lethal — it wants the Hero's Box, which it now suspects one of them may be carrying or may be connected to. It will hurt them. It will demand it. And then John opens the box.
