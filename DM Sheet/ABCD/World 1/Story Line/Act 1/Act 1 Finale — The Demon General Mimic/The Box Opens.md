This triggers when a player tells John to try the box — in a moment of desperation, as a last idea, because there is nothing else left to try.
John has been told before. Michael told him, more than once, in the way Michael tells people things — gently, with patience, without pressure. John always said no. He didn't see himself as anything the box would respond to.
He picks it up now because someone asked and because there is nothing else.
The box does not glow. It does not make a sound. It simply — opens. Like it was never locked. Like it has been waiting for exactly this.
Inside is nothing that looks like a weapon. A small mark — a seal, a sigil, something that has no immediate name — lifts from the interior of the box as if it were always meant to go somewhere. It finds John's hand. It burns in, slow and deliberate, like something being written rather than branded. John makes no sound. His expression is unreadable.
Then the mark flares.
The light that comes from it is not like Luna's healing light or Michael's divine condemnation. It is quieter than that, and somehow worse — a focused, personal radiance that has no interest in illuminating anything except its target. It hits Vael'shar like a weight. Not an explosion. Not a beam. Just — pressure, and heat, and the specific quality of something that recognizes what Vael'shar is and has decided it is not welcome here.
Vael'shar is wounded. Not critically. Not enough to change what it is. But it steps back — and for a creature that has never needed to step back from anything the party has seen, the sight of it doing so lands hard.
It looks at John for a long moment.
Then it leaves. No words. No threat. It simply turns and is gone, folding back into shadow and road and the ordinary-looking forest, and the silence it leaves behind is the most unsettling thing about the whole encounter. A creature like that does not retreat to regroup. It retreats because it has learned something. And it will act on what it learned.
John stares at the mark on his hand for a long moment. The box is empty now — whatever was inside it is part of him. He closes his hand slowly.
Nobody says anything. There is nothing to say yet.

## What the mark is

The mark is John's Hero Candidate seal — the Goddess's acknowledgment that this person has the potential to become a Hero. It is not a power grant. It is a recognition. The power that came from it was John's own, expressed through the seal for the first time, raw and uncontrolled and enough.
