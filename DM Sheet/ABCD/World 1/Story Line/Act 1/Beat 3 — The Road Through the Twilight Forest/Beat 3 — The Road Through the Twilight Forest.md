_Location: The Twilight Forest road_
The group sets out. The transition from open land to forest is gradual, but once they're inside the shift in atmosphere is immediate. The colors are wrong. The light is wrong. Things move in the treeline.

**How to run it:**
- Describe the forest slowly — let the wrongness land before anything actually happens
- Michael walks calmly, seemingly unbothered, though he keeps his staff close
- Luna stays alert but covers it with chatter — she talks more when she's uneasy
- John goes quiet in a different way than usual — watchful, hand near his weapon
- Emmet stays very close to whoever seems most capable and tries not to look at the treeline
  
**The Duskbloom detour:**
- At some point Emmet spots what looks like Duskbloom just inside the treeline — maybe thirty feet off the path
- Getting them means leaving the road briefly
- The forest is not immediately hostile but it is watching — whatever lives here knows they're here
- This is a skill and roleplay challenge as much as a combat one: how do players protect Emmet, manage the group, and get back safely?
- If they succeed, Emmet carefully wraps the flowers in cloth from his coat lining. He doesn't say much. He just looks at them for a moment.

**Optional encounter — Named Beast:**
- One of the named beasts of the Twilight Forest can appear here as an optional combat encounter
- It should be challenging but not a guaranteed fight — clever players might drive it off or avoid it entirely
- Defeating it is an achievement. Running from it intelligently is also valid and patron-entertaining.
  
**Achievements available:**
- _Into the Dark_ — Leave the road to retrieve the Duskbloom
- _Beast Slayer_ — Defeat the named beast of the Twilight Forest
- _Tactical Retreat_ — Successfully avoid or escape the named beast without casualties
- _Florist_ — Retrieve a perfect bundle of Duskbloom with no damage to the flowers
  
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player stays close to Emmet unprompted and keeps him calm during the forest stretch
- A player makes a genuinely funny or daring call about leaving the road — reward the commitment either way
- John quietly steps up during the beast encounter without being asked — if a player noticed and acknowledges it in character, reward that
- A player does something clever to avoid or handle the named beast rather than just swinging at it
  
**Coming next in Act 1:**
- Arrival in Lowfield — meeting Edna, Benno, and Renwick for the first time
- Emmet's growing attachment to the party
- The onward journey to Caldenveil
- Emmet and Sera
