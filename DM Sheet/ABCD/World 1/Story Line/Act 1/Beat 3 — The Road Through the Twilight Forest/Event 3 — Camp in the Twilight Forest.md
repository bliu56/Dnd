_Type: Rest / Roleplay_
The group stops to make camp just off the road — not far, just enough to get clear of the immediate sightlines. The fog has thinned slightly but not gone. The forest glimmers around them in the dark, violet light pulsing faintly from the bark and undergrowth. It is, objectively, a beautiful place to sleep in. Nobody is fully comfortable.
A fire is made. Watches are assigned. Food is shared — Emmet has brought more than expected and insists on contributing, which is the most useful he has been all day.
**NPC behavior at camp:**
- **Michael** sits close to the fire, relaxed, seemingly at ease. He is the kind of person who has learned to rest when rest is available. He will talk to anyone who approaches him, and his questions tend to be genuine rather than polite.
- **Luna** stays busy — checks equipment, tends to any injuries, then eventually settles down and becomes more talkative the longer the night goes on. She is chattier in the dark than she is on the road.
- **John** eats, says little, and watches the treeline. He will answer direct questions with direct answers and nothing more. He is not unfriendly — he just doesn't volunteer.
- **Emmet** is quietly processing the day. He checks on the Duskbloom several times to make sure they survived the journey intact. He will talk about Sera if anyone asks, at length, with the slightly dazed expression of someone who still can't quite believe the afternoon in Lowfield happened.
**Conversation prompts — things NPCs may ask players:**
- _Michael to anyone:_ "What brought you to this kind of work? Guide licensing isn't the most obvious path."
- _Michael to anyone:_ "Do you believe the Hero will be found? Genuinely — not the Church line. What do you think?"
- _Luna to anyone she's warmed to:_ "Do you ever get scared? On a job like this, I mean. Or does it stop bothering you eventually?"
- _Luna to anyone:_ "Where are you going after Caldenveil? Or is this just — one job at a time?"
- _John if directly asked about himself:_ "I'm here to do the work. That's all." — but if pushed genuinely: "I had something I needed to be closer to. The Church put me in the right direction."
- _Emmet to anyone who sits near him:_ "Can I ask you something? When you do something terrifying — does it ever start to feel normal? Or does it always feel like the first time?"
**The training request (conditional — strong/acceptable performance only):**
After camp has settled and the fire has burned lower, Michael approaches whichever player performed best in the beast encounter — or the group as a whole if the performance was collectively strong. He is direct about it, no preamble:
_"John trains alone. He always has. I've been trying to find the right moment to suggest he work with someone who can push back. Would any of you be willing to spar with him — properly — tomorrow, or along the road?"_
If players agree, John doesn't object. He doesn't look pleased either. He just nods once and goes back to watching the treeline.
If players ask why John doesn't train with Michael or Luna: Michael smiles quietly. _"He's already past what I can offer him in that regard. Luna would heal him before he learned anything. He needs someone who'll hit him back."_
**John's late-night training:**
Regardless of how camp goes, sometime in the deep of the night — during a watch change or a quiet moment — John slips away from camp into the forest. He doesn't go far. The sounds of controlled movement, the muffled impact of strikes against a tree, the quiet rhythm of someone who has done this every night for years, drift back faintly.
- A player on watch has the highest chance of noticing — DC 12 Perception
- A player who is awake for any reason can also roll
- If noticed: the player can observe quietly, follow him, or wake someone. John will not stop if approached — he'll acknowledge the player with a look and keep going. If asked why: _"I sleep better after."_
- If nobody notices: describe the faint sounds to the table in the morning briefing — "at some point in the night, you may have heard something" — and let them piece it together
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player has a genuine, unscripted conversation with an NPC that goes somewhere unexpected
- A player shares something real about their character's motivations unprompted
- A player follows John into the forest and just — trains with him, without making it a scene
- A player comforts Emmet about the day in a way that feels earned
- Someone asks Michael about Arthur — he'll deflect warmly, but reward the instinct
