_Triggered after the clearing, lasts until Lowfield_
Whether or not the players found the cabin, something changes in the forest after Event 4. The party begins to notice — gradually, then unmistakably — that something is behind them.
It is not subtle. Branches shift in their wake in a pattern that doesn't match the wind. The fog moves around something that isn't visible. Perception checks confirm it: something large, something aware, something that is keeping exact pace with the group without closing the distance.
It does not attack. It does not make a sound. But it is there, and it knows they know, and it doesn't care.

## How to run it

- Describe it in increments — the first sign is easy to dismiss, the second less so, the third is undeniable
- Let players decide how to respond: ignore it, try to confront it, move faster, set a trap
- If they try to confront it: the fog shifts, something moves — large, definitely larger than anything they fought earlier — and then it is simply not where it was. It is behind them again.
- If they set a trap: the trap triggers on nothing. Whatever it is, it was not where they thought it was.
- John's jaw tightens. He does not draw his weapon. He keeps walking.
- Michael watches the treeline for a long moment, then faces forward again. His expression is unreadable.

## When they reach Lowfield

The moment the first player steps past the tree line into the open ground approaching Lowfield, the presence stops. Not gradually — immediately. The fog thins. The forest behind them is still. Whatever was following them is gone, and has been gone since the tree line, as if it simply ceased at the border.
Nobody says anything about it. Nobody needs to.

## Point Moments (DM Only)

- A player tries something genuinely creative to identify or confront the presence
- A player notices John's reaction and comments on it in character
- A player is the last one to step out of the forest and pauses at the tree line to look back — reward that instinct
