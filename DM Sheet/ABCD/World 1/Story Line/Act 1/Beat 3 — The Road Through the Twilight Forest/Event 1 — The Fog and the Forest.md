_Type: Atmosphere / Navigation_
Not long after the group enters the Twilight Forest, the violet fog rolls in. It doesn't arrive like weather — it arrives like a decision, thickening between the trees until visibility drops to thirty feet in every direction. The forest is still visible through it: glimmering purples and deep violets, the strange bioluminescent quality of the corrupted bark and undergrowth catching the fog's light and throwing it back in shifting patterns. If not for what lurks here, it would be genuinely beautiful. Several players may find themselves saying so despite themselves.
The road is still underfoot but harder to trust. Sounds are muffled and directionless. Something moves in the treeline — or multiple somethings — but nothing approaches.

## How to run it

- Open with a slow, vivid description of the fog and the forest's appearance — let the beauty land before the unease does
- Ask players how they're reacting and moving: bunched together, spread out, weapons drawn or not
- Michael walks without visible anxiety, staff in hand, eyes forward — he has traveled dangerous roads before
- Luna talks a little too much and a little too fast, filling the silence
- John stops talking entirely, moves to the rear of the group, and watches behind them without being asked
- Emmet is trying very hard not to be a burden and is failing slightly — he keeps almost tripping over his own feet from looking into the trees

## Navigation challenge

- Run a light perception or survival check for whoever is leading
- On a success: the group moves through cleanly, no issue
- On a failure: the group drifts slightly off the road without realizing it — not far, but far enough that the fog feels different around them, closer, and getting back takes a moment of scrambling
- This is not a dangerous failure, just an atmospheric one — it establishes that the forest can disorient even when nothing is attacking

## Point Moments (DM Only)

- A player comments on the forest's beauty despite the danger — genuine, not sarcastic
- A player notices John has moved to the rear and says nothing, just adjusts their own position accordingly
- Someone checks on Emmet without being prompted
