_Type: Combat_
Something in the Twilight Forest finds the group. Pick one of the three beasts below based on what fits the session — or roll randomly. Each was once a common forest animal. Twenty years inside the Twilight Forest has done the rest.
**The Beasts:**
**Veilstag** _(formerly a stag)_
A stag the size of a draft horse, its antlers fused into a single twisted crown of black bone that pulses faintly violet at the tips. Its coat has gone translucent in patches, revealing the mana running through it like veins of light beneath the skin. It moves without sound — not quietly, but silently, as if the sound has simply been removed from its footsteps. It does not charge immediately. It watches first.
_Behavior:_ Territorial. It wants the group out of its range, not necessarily dead. It will charge if approached or if the group lingers too long. Can be driven off without being killed if players make enough noise, light, or force it to take significant damage.
- **AC:** 15 | **HP:** 95 | **Speed:** 50 ft.
- **CR:** 5
- _**Silence Step.**_ The Veilstag makes no sound when it moves. It cannot be heard approaching and does not trigger sound-based reactions.
- _**Gore.** +7 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 2d8+5 piercing. On a hit, the target is pushed 10 ft. and must make a DC 14 Str save or be knocked prone.
- _**Mana Pulse (Recharge 5–6).**_ The antlers release a burst of corrupted mana in a 20 ft. cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Con save, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a fail or half on a success.
- _**Territorial Charge.**_ If the Veilstag moves at least 20 ft. in a straight line before hitting, the Gore attack deals an additional 2d8 damage.
**Ashcrawler** _(formerly a bear)_
A bear, or what was one. Its body has bloated and hardened, the fur replaced in places by a thick chitinous plating the color of charcoal. Its eyes are gone — replaced by six small glowing points of violet light arranged across its face. It navigates entirely by sensing mana, which means it is blind to creatures who aren't using magic and acutely aware of those who are. It moves on all fours but can rear up to a terrifying height.
_Behavior:_ Aggressive and direct once it detects the group. It prioritizes spellcasters or anyone actively using magic above others. Cannot be easily driven off — it commits once it engages.
- **AC:** 16 (natural armor) | **HP:** 120 | **Speed:** 40 ft.
- **CR:** 6
- _**Mana Sense.**_ The Ashcrawler automatically detects any creature using magic within 60 ft. It has advantage on attacks against creatures that have cast a spell this encounter.
- _**Blind to the Mundane.**_ Creatures that have not used magic this encounter are effectively invisible to the Ashcrawler — it must guess their location. Attacks against such creatures have disadvantage.
- _**Slam.** +8 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 2d10+5 bludgeoning. On a hit, the target makes a DC 15 Con save or is stunned until the end of their next turn.
- _**Plated Charge.**_ Once per encounter: the Ashcrawler charges up to 40 ft. in a line. Each creature in its path makes a DC 15 Dex save, taking 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a fail or half on a success.
- _**Chitin Armor.**_ The first time the Ashcrawler would take more than 15 damage from a single hit, reduce that damage by 10.
**Duskwing** _(formerly a large owl)_
A massive owl, wingspan stretching twelve feet, its feathers now the deep black-violet of the forest at its worst. The feathers at the wingtips have hardened into something resembling blades. It flies without disturbing the air — no downwash, no sound. Its call, when it makes one, is not a screech but a low resonant tone that rattles in the chest. It hunts from above and prefers to separate its prey from the group before striking.
_Behavior:_ Methodical and patient. It circles above the fog line and waits for a target to fall behind or be isolated. It will break off if it takes significant damage, retreat into the fog, and may return once — players should feel like it's watching even after it withdraws.
- **AC:** 14 | **HP:** 78 | **Speed:** 10 ft. / fly 60 ft.
- **CR:** 4
- _**Silent Flight.**_ The Duskwing makes no sound while flying. It cannot be heard and does not trigger opportunity attacks caused by sound detection.
- _**Isolation Strike.**_ If the Duskwing attacks a creature that has no ally within 10 ft., the attack deals an additional 2d6 damage and the target must make a DC 13 Wis save or be frightened until the end of their next turn.
- _**Talon Rake.** +6 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 2d6+4 slashing. On a hit, the target's movement speed is reduced by 10 ft. until the end of their next turn (blade-feather cuts).
- _**Resonance Call (1/Day).**_ The Duskwing emits its deep tone. Each creature within 30 ft. makes a DC 13 Con save or is incapacitated until the end of their next turn as the sound disrupts their focus.
- _**Fade and Return.**_ If the Duskwing takes 20 or more damage in a single turn, it retreats into the fog. It may return at the start of the next round on a roll of 4–6 (d6), arriving from a different direction.
**How to run the encounter:**
- Give the party a moment of warning — a sound, a shadow, a feeling — before the beast fully reveals itself
- Michael will engage if necessary but defers to the players — this is their job
- Luna will heal and support, staying behind cover
- John will fight — efficiently, without flourish, and noticeably well for someone of his stated rank
- Emmet will find the nearest large tree and stay behind it. He will not be useful. He will be apologetic about this afterward.
- After the fight, if John performed well, Michael will quietly note it to whoever is nearest — "he always does that"
**How performance affects camp:**
- _Strong performance_ (the party handled it cleanly, protected the escort targets, made smart decisions): The training request happens at camp
- _Acceptable performance_ (they won but it was messy): Michael considers it — the request may happen but with less certainty, or only if a specific player stood out
- _Poor performance_ (escort targets were endangered, players made reckless decisions): No training request. Michael and Luna are quieter at camp. John says nothing.
**Achievements available:**
- _Beast Slayer_ — Defeat the mutated beast
- _Not a Scratch_ — Complete the encounter with no escort target taking damage
- _Identify the Hunt_ — Correctly identify the creature's behavior pattern and exploit it
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player uses a creative or unexpected solution rather than straight damage
- A player specifically positions themselves to protect Emmet without being asked
- A player notices John fighting and comments on it in character
- Someone makes a decision that's genuinely funny or genuinely daring mid-combat
