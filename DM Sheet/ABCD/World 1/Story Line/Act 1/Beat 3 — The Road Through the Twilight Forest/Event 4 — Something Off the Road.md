_Type: Exploration / Atmosphere (Chance — triggers only if players leave the road or investigate)_
This event does not happen automatically. It requires the players to make a choice — to leave the road or follow something into the trees. Pick one of the triggers below based on what fits the session, or let player curiosity do the work naturally.
**Possible triggers:**
- _The glint:_ Emmet notices something catching the violet light between the trees — too regular to be bark, too still to be a creature. He mentions it quietly, not sure if it's worth saying anything.
- _The sound:_ One player hears something faint and rhythmic deeper in the forest. Not threatening — almost musical, like wind moving through something hollow. It doesn't repeat if they stop to listen. It starts again when they walk.
- _The animal:_ A small creature — something that was once a fox, now with an extra pair of legs and fur the color of twilight — darts off the road ahead of them and stops twenty feet into the trees. It looks back. Then moves again, slowly, like it is waiting.
- _The feeling:_ No trigger — a player simply decides to leave the road and investigate the forest. The others may follow or not.
**If they follow:**
The fog thickens almost immediately — not gradually, but in distinct steps, as if responding to their movement. The trees grow older and more widely spaced the further they go. The undergrowth is wrong in a way that's hard to articulate: things growing that have no business growing here, in colors that don't exist in normal forests.
Then the trees open into a clearing.
At the far edge of it, half-swallowed by the Twilight Forest's creeping vegetation but unmistakably intact, is a house. Wooden, hand-built, carefully made. A covered porch. A cleared practice area in front. The trees around it are dark and strange but the clearing itself is — still. Quiet in a way the rest of the forest is not. The fog does not enter the clearing.
The party can see it clearly from the tree line. They cannot get closer.
**The fog barrier:**
As players move toward the clearing, the fog thickens along the path ahead — not dramatically, not with sound or force, but with a kind of absolute certainty. Visibility drops to zero in the direction of the house. Players who push into it feel — not threatened, not in pain — but deeply, instinctively unwelcome. Like walking into a room that belongs to someone and knowing it the moment you cross the threshold. Most players will stop on their own. If a player pushes through regardless, they emerge on the other side of the fog patch still at the treeline — as if the fog has simply redirected them without their noticing.
**What they can see from the treeline:**
- The house is intact and maintained — not a ruin
- The door is closed but there is no lock visible
- There are no lights inside
- The practice area in front shows signs of recent use — disturbed earth, the impression of footwork patterns in the ground
- The vegetation around the clearing stops at a clean, unnatural line — as if something has told it not to cross
Nobody lives there. Or — nobody is there right now.
**DM note:** Do not name the house. Do not explain it. Let players speculate. If Michael sees it, he goes very still and says nothing. If pressed, he says quietly: _"We should keep moving."_ He doesn't look back.
