_Location: Stonewood South Gate, just before departure_
Just as the group is about to set off, a young man pushes through the small crowd near the gate and calls out to them. This is **Emmet Ashford** _(EM-et ASH-ford)_, mid-twenties, a textile merchant's son from Stonewood. He is visibly nervous, clutching his coat, and has clearly rehearsed what he is about to say.

## Who he is

- Works at his family's textile stall in Stonewood's market district
- Cheerful, earnest, a little bumbling — but genuinely kind
- Met a girl named **Sera Voss** _(SEH-rah VOSS)_ at Lowfield's pasture market months ago. She was on a supply run from Caldenveil; he was visiting Renwick, an old family contact. They spent an afternoon talking. He hasn't stopped thinking about her since.
- Has been too nervous to make the journey alone — the Twilight Forest makes the road dangerous and he has no combat ability whatsoever

## His request

Emmet asks — politely, then a little desperately — if he can join the group as far as Caldenveil. He offers to pay what he can. If players ask why he can't just wait for another escort, he admits there's a second reason.
He wants to stop in the Twilight Forest — not deep, just inside the treeline. His father used to tell a story: troubled about how to court Emmet's mother, he encountered six kind strangers who helped him gather rare flowers from the forest. He brought them to her and she said yes. The flowers were **Duskbloom** — deep violet petals that glow faintly at night, found only in the Twilight Forest. Emmet has always loved that story. He wants to bring Sera a bundle. He knows the forest is dangerous now. He knows it's a lot to ask. He asks anyway.

## How to run it

- Emmet's nervousness should be endearing — he's not a compelling speaker, he just clearly means every word
- Michael will almost certainly advocate for taking him along
- Luna will have opinions, loudly
- John will probably say it's their call and look away
- Players decide — but the Duskbloom errand seeds the forest detour naturally
- If players agree, Emmet is overwhelmed with relief and thanks them too many times

## Achievements available

- _Good Samaritans_ — Agree to take Emmet along without requiring payment
- _Oppertunist_ — Successfully negotiate payment or a favor from Emmet before agreeing

## Point Moments (DM Only)

- A player genuinely engages with Emmet's story rather than just accepting or rejecting the request
- A player asks Emmet to describe Sera and he gets flustered — reward whoever pushed that button
- A player takes Emmet's side against skeptical party members in a way that feels warm rather than transactional
- Someone makes a joke at Emmet's expense that lands well at the table — reward the read
