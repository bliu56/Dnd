_Location: Stonewood South Gate_
The players spawn just outside Stonewood and make their way to the city gate where their escort assignment begins. They each carry an E-rank Guide License — the lowest tier, freshly issued, clearly magical in origin. At the gate they find Michael, Luna, and John already waiting.

## How to run it

- Give players a moment to introduce themselves to each other and to the group they're escorting
- Michael is warm and welcoming immediately — he thanks them sincerely and means it
- Luna sizes them up with obvious curiosity, probably makes a comment about their rank
- John says very little, gives each player a once-over, and goes back to watching the road
- Let this breathe — this is the first chance for players to get a read on all three and for NPC attachment to begin seeding naturally
- Captain Aldric may appear briefly at the gate to see Michael off — a small moment that establishes the Church's presence in the city and Aldric's relationship with duty

## Achievements available

- _First Impression_ — Make a strong introduction that gets a visible reaction from one of the three (Luna laughing, John actually responding, Michael being genuinely moved)

## Point Moments (DM Only)

- A player does something memorable during introductions — an unexpected greeting, immediately trying to size up John, making Michael laugh
- A player asks one of the three something personal and actually listens to the answer
- The group organically establishes a dynamic among themselves before even leaving the gate
