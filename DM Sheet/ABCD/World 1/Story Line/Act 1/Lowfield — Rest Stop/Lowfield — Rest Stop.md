_Type: Rest / Character / Atmosphere_
Lowfield hits differently after the Twilight Forest. The lane is unpaved and quiet, the houses are small, chickens wander freely, and somewhere nearby someone is baking bread. It is aggressively, almost stubbornly normal. After what the party just walked through, normal is disorienting in the best possible way.
Michael exhales when they arrive — genuinely, visibly. Luna immediately starts talking at full volume again, like someone who has been holding it in. John looks at the village for a long moment, something unreadable crossing his face, and then says nothing. Emmet starts smiling and doesn't stop.
The party has time. Let them use it however they want. The moments below can happen in any order, or not at all — follow where players go.
