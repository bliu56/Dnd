Emmet is having the best day he has had in months. He knows this village — he has been here before, that one afternoon with Sera — and being back in it makes him happy in a slightly overwhelming way. He keeps stopping to look at things. The bench outside Edna's cafe. The spot at the pasture market where Sera's cart was parked. The lane itself.
If any player walks with him, he will talk. Not about Sera specifically — he is trying to play it cool and failing — but about the afternoon they met. The way she explained the pricing of preserved goods to him like it was fascinating rather than commercial. The fact that she laughed at something he said and he still isn't sure if it was at him or with him but he chooses to believe with him. The way she looked when she was packing up her cart to leave.
He stops at one point and looks at the pasture market and says, half to himself: _"I've never done anything brave before. In my whole life. Yesterday was the first time."_ He clearly means the forest, the flowers, the asking. He does not seem to realize he has said this out loud until a beat later, when he looks slightly embarrassed. _"Anyway."_
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player walks the lane with Emmet without being asked to
- A player responds to Emmet's accidental admission in a way that is kind without being condescending
