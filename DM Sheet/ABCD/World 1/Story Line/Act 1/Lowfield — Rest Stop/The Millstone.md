Benno has rooms ready. He always has rooms ready — it is simply what he does. He doesn't make a fuss about the party's arrival, just checks them in efficiently and shows them where things are. The rooms are clean. The beds are real beds. After the forest floor this is remarkable.
If players linger in the common room, Benno will be there — not hovering, just present. He keeps busy. He is not a gossip and does not ask questions about where they've been or where they're going. But he pays attention. If a player looks worn down he will quietly set something warm in front of them without comment.
At some point during the stay, if any player is up late or wanders downstairs, they may notice: one of the three rooms upstairs has its door slightly ajar, and inside it is clearly not being used for storage or guests. The bed is made with particular care. There is nothing in the room except furniture — no personal effects, no decoration — but it is maintained like it matters. If a player asks Benno about it he pauses in what he's doing and says: _"That room's taken."_ He does not explain. He does not seem to think further explanation is required.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player notices the reserved room and follows up with Benno
- A player thanks Benno genuinely — not just in passing — and he actually looks up from what he's doing
