The village lane is exactly what it looks like: a quiet unpaved road, gardens on either side, neighbors occasionally calling to each other across it. There is nothing suspicious here. There is nothing wrong. It is just a village that is fine, in a world where villages are not supposed to be fine anymore.
If players walk the lane they may notice, without being told to look: there are no abandoned houses. Every building is occupied, every garden is tended. In the broader world, villages this size have lost a third of their population to raids or evacuation. This one hasn't lost anyone. The community stockpile in the old barn at the edge of the pasture — visible through the open doors if players pass it — is quietly enormous for a village this size, neatly organized, and clearly added to regularly. Nobody seems to be in charge of it. It simply exists.
An older farmer — Renwick, if players encounter him — will answer questions about the village in the fewest possible words. He is not evasive, just economical. If players ask directly why Lowfield has been untouched by the war, he looks at them for a long moment and says: _"Don't know. Thought about it. Don't know."_ Then, after a pause: _"There was a man used to come through here. Him and his boy. Good man. Real quiet. Forest type."_ He does not continue unless asked. If asked: _"Haven't seen him in a long time. Boy neither."_ He picks up whatever he was doing. The conversation is over unless players reopen it.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player puts the stockpile, the intact houses, and Renwick's comment together and says something about it out loud
- A player asks Renwick a follow-up question about the man and his boy and actually sits down to hear the answer
