Edna knows they're coming before they arrive. Word travels fast in Lowfield and a group of six escorts plus an Archbishop is not something that goes unnoticed on the lane. By the time the party reaches the cafe, there is already food on the counter.
She feeds them first and asks questions second — that is simply how she operates. The food is good. Better than good. After two days in the Twilight Forest it is almost aggressively comforting.
Edna will talk to anyone who lets her. She is warm, sharp, and completely unintimidated by anyone at the table. If players ask about the village she answers easily — the farms, the families, the weather, who is feuding with whom over a fence line. She does not bring up the war. She does not bring up demons. If players bring it up themselves she pauses, then says simply: _"Nothing bad comes here. Never has, even now. We don't ask why. We just count ourselves lucky."_ Then she moves on.
On the wall behind the counter, among other small things, is a hand-drawn sketch in a simple frame. It shows a boy — maybe twelve — sitting on the bench outside the cafe, eating something. The drawing is old, the edges worn. The boy in it looks exactly like he could have sat down yesterday.
Edna does not point it out. She does not mention it unless asked. If a player notices and asks who it is, she looks at it for a moment with an expression that is warm and a little complicated: _"A boy who used to come through with his father. Years ago now."_ She does not say more unless pushed. If pushed further: _"He had a sweet tooth something terrible. I always made sure there was something ready."_ She does not say his name.

## Point Moments (DM Only)

- A player notices the sketch on their own without being prompted
- A player asks Edna about the village's safety and genuinely listens to her non-answer
- A player just sits quietly and eats without doing anything — reward the rest
