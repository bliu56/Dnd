## Overview

The players begin outside Stonewood's gates, freshly assigned as E-rank licensed escorts. Their job is simple on paper: bring Michael, Luna, and John safely from Stonewood to Lowfield, and then onward to Caldenveil _(KAL-den-vale)_. What starts as a routine escort becomes their first real encounter with the world — its warmth, its danger, and the weight of what the Twilight Forest used to be.
