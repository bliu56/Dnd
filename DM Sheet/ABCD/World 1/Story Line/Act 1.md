# Act 1 — The Road to Lowfield (Present)

**Overview**
The players begin outside Stonewood's gates, freshly assigned as E-rank licensed escorts. Their job is simple on paper: bring Michael, Luna, and John safely from Stonewood to Lowfield, and then onward to Caldenveil _(KAL-den-vale)_. What starts as a routine escort becomes their first real encounter with the world — its warmth, its danger, and the weight of what the Twilight Forest used to be.

## Beat 1 — Arrival at the Gate

_Location: Stonewood South Gate_
The players spawn just outside Stonewood and make their way to the city gate where their escort assignment begins. They each carry an E-rank Guide License — the lowest tier, freshly issued, clearly magical in origin. At the gate they find Michael, Luna, and John already waiting.
**How to run it:**
- Give players a moment to introduce themselves to each other and to the group they're escorting
- Michael is warm and welcoming immediately — he thanks them sincerely and means it
- Luna sizes them up with obvious curiosity, probably makes a comment about their rank
- John says very little, gives each player a once-over, and goes back to watching the road
- Let this breathe — this is the first chance for players to get a read on all three and for NPC attachment to begin seeding naturally
- Captain Aldric may appear briefly at the gate to see Michael off — a small moment that establishes the Church's presence in the city and Aldric's relationship with duty
**Achievements available:**
- _First Impression_ — Make a strong introduction that gets a visible reaction from one of the three (Luna laughing, John actually responding, Michael being genuinely moved)
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player does something memorable during introductions — an unexpected greeting, immediately trying to size up John, making Michael laugh
- A player asks one of the three something personal and actually listens to the answer
- The group organically establishes a dynamic among themselves before even leaving the gate

## Beat 2 — Emmet Ashford

_Location: Stonewood South Gate, just before departure_
Just as the group is about to set off, a young man pushes through the small crowd near the gate and calls out to them. This is **Emmet Ashford** _(EM-et ASH-ford)_, mid-twenties, a textile merchant's son from Stonewood. He is visibly nervous, clutching his coat, and has clearly rehearsed what he is about to say.
**Who he is:**
- Works at his family's textile stall in Stonewood's market district
- Cheerful, earnest, a little bumbling — but genuinely kind
- Met a girl named **Sera Voss** _(SEH-rah VOSS)_ at Lowfield's pasture market months ago. She was on a supply run from Caldenveil; he was visiting Renwick, an old family contact. They spent an afternoon talking. He hasn't stopped thinking about her since.
- Has been too nervous to make the journey alone — the Twilight Forest makes the road dangerous and he has no combat ability whatsoever
**His request:**
Emmet asks — politely, then a little desperately — if he can join the group as far as Caldenveil. He offers to pay what he can. If players ask why he can't just wait for another escort, he admits there's a second reason.
He wants to stop in the Twilight Forest — not deep, just inside the treeline. His father used to tell a story: troubled about how to court Emmet's mother, he encountered six kind strangers who helped him gather rare flowers from the forest. He brought them to her and she said yes. The flowers were **Duskbloom** — deep violet petals that glow faintly at night, found only in the Twilight Forest. Emmet has always loved that story. He wants to bring Sera a bundle. He knows the forest is dangerous now. He knows it's a lot to ask. He asks anyway.
**How to run it:**
- Emmet's nervousness should be endearing — he's not a compelling speaker, he just clearly means every word
- Michael will almost certainly advocate for taking him along
- Luna will have opinions, loudly
- John will probably say it's their call and look away
- Players decide — but the Duskbloom errand seeds the forest detour naturally
- If players agree, Emmet is overwhelmed with relief and thanks them too many times
**Achievements available:**
- _Good Samaritans_ — Agree to take Emmet along without requiring payment
- _Oppertunist_ — Successfully negotiate payment or a favor from Emmet before agreeing
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player genuinely engages with Emmet's story rather than just accepting or rejecting the request
- A player asks Emmet to describe Sera and he gets flustered — reward whoever pushed that button
- A player takes Emmet's side against skeptical party members in a way that feels warm rather than transactional
- Someone makes a joke at Emmet's expense that lands well at the table — reward the read

## Beat 3 — The Road Through the Twilight Forest

_Location: The Twilight Forest road_
The group sets out. The transition from open land to forest is gradual, but once they're inside the shift in atmosphere is immediate. The colors are wrong. The light is wrong. Things move in the treeline.

**How to run it:**
- Describe the forest slowly — let the wrongness land before anything actually happens
- Michael walks calmly, seemingly unbothered, though he keeps his staff close
- Luna stays alert but covers it with chatter — she talks more when she's uneasy
- John goes quiet in a different way than usual — watchful, hand near his weapon
- Emmet stays very close to whoever seems most capable and tries not to look at the treeline
  
**The Duskbloom detour:**
- At some point Emmet spots what looks like Duskbloom just inside the treeline — maybe thirty feet off the path
- Getting them means leaving the road briefly
- The forest is not immediately hostile but it is watching — whatever lives here knows they're here
- This is a skill and roleplay challenge as much as a combat one: how do players protect Emmet, manage the group, and get back safely?
- If they succeed, Emmet carefully wraps the flowers in cloth from his coat lining. He doesn't say much. He just looks at them for a moment.

**Optional encounter — Named Beast:**
- One of the named beasts of the Twilight Forest can appear here as an optional combat encounter
- It should be challenging but not a guaranteed fight — clever players might drive it off or avoid it entirely
- Defeating it is an achievement. Running from it intelligently is also valid and patron-entertaining.
  
**Achievements available:**
- _Into the Dark_ — Leave the road to retrieve the Duskbloom
- _Beast Slayer_ — Defeat the named beast of the Twilight Forest
- _Tactical Retreat_ — Successfully avoid or escape the named beast without casualties
- _Florist_ — Retrieve a perfect bundle of Duskbloom with no damage to the flowers
  
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player stays close to Emmet unprompted and keeps him calm during the forest stretch
- A player makes a genuinely funny or daring call about leaving the road — reward the commitment either way
- John quietly steps up during the beast encounter without being asked — if a player noticed and acknowledges it in character, reward that
- A player does something clever to avoid or handle the named beast rather than just swinging at it
  
**Coming next in Act 1:**
- Arrival in Lowfield — meeting Edna, Benno, and Renwick for the first time
- Emmet's growing attachment to the party
- The onward journey to Caldenveil
- Emmet and Sera

## Event 1 — The Fog and the Forest

_Type: Atmosphere / Navigation_
Not long after the group enters the Twilight Forest, the violet fog rolls in. It doesn't arrive like weather — it arrives like a decision, thickening between the trees until visibility drops to thirty feet in every direction. The forest is still visible through it: glimmering purples and deep violets, the strange bioluminescent quality of the corrupted bark and undergrowth catching the fog's light and throwing it back in shifting patterns. If not for what lurks here, it would be genuinely beautiful. Several players may find themselves saying so despite themselves.
The road is still underfoot but harder to trust. Sounds are muffled and directionless. Something moves in the treeline — or multiple somethings — but nothing approaches.
**How to run it:**
- Open with a slow, vivid description of the fog and the forest's appearance — let the beauty land before the unease does
- Ask players how they're reacting and moving: bunched together, spread out, weapons drawn or not
- Michael walks without visible anxiety, staff in hand, eyes forward — he has traveled dangerous roads before
- Luna talks a little too much and a little too fast, filling the silence
- John stops talking entirely, moves to the rear of the group, and watches behind them without being asked
- Emmet is trying very hard not to be a burden and is failing slightly — he keeps almost tripping over his own feet from looking into the trees
**Navigation challenge:**
- Run a light perception or survival check for whoever is leading
- On a success: the group moves through cleanly, no issue
- On a failure: the group drifts slightly off the road without realizing it — not far, but far enough that the fog feels different around them, closer, and getting back takes a moment of scrambling
- This is not a dangerous failure, just an atmospheric one — it establishes that the forest can disorient even when nothing is attacking
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player comments on the forest's beauty despite the danger — genuine, not sarcastic
- A player notices John has moved to the rear and says nothing, just adjusts their own position accordingly
- Someone checks on Emmet without being prompted

## Event 2 — The Mutated Beast

_Type: Combat_
Something in the Twilight Forest finds the group. Pick one of the three beasts below based on what fits the session — or roll randomly. Each was once a common forest animal. Twenty years inside the Twilight Forest has done the rest.
**The Beasts:**
**Veilstag** _(formerly a stag)_
A stag the size of a draft horse, its antlers fused into a single twisted crown of black bone that pulses faintly violet at the tips. Its coat has gone translucent in patches, revealing the mana running through it like veins of light beneath the skin. It moves without sound — not quietly, but silently, as if the sound has simply been removed from its footsteps. It does not charge immediately. It watches first.
_Behavior:_ Territorial. It wants the group out of its range, not necessarily dead. It will charge if approached or if the group lingers too long. Can be driven off without being killed if players make enough noise, light, or force it to take significant damage.
- **AC:** 15 | **HP:** 95 | **Speed:** 50 ft.
- **CR:** 5
- _**Silence Step.**_ The Veilstag makes no sound when it moves. It cannot be heard approaching and does not trigger sound-based reactions.
- _**Gore.** +7 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 2d8+5 piercing. On a hit, the target is pushed 10 ft. and must make a DC 14 Str save or be knocked prone.
- _**Mana Pulse (Recharge 5–6).**_ The antlers release a burst of corrupted mana in a 20 ft. cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Con save, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a fail or half on a success.
- _**Territorial Charge.**_ If the Veilstag moves at least 20 ft. in a straight line before hitting, the Gore attack deals an additional 2d8 damage.
**Ashcrawler** _(formerly a bear)_
A bear, or what was one. Its body has bloated and hardened, the fur replaced in places by a thick chitinous plating the color of charcoal. Its eyes are gone — replaced by six small glowing points of violet light arranged across its face. It navigates entirely by sensing mana, which means it is blind to creatures who aren't using magic and acutely aware of those who are. It moves on all fours but can rear up to a terrifying height.
_Behavior:_ Aggressive and direct once it detects the group. It prioritizes spellcasters or anyone actively using magic above others. Cannot be easily driven off — it commits once it engages.
- **AC:** 16 (natural armor) | **HP:** 120 | **Speed:** 40 ft.
- **CR:** 6
- _**Mana Sense.**_ The Ashcrawler automatically detects any creature using magic within 60 ft. It has advantage on attacks against creatures that have cast a spell this encounter.
- _**Blind to the Mundane.**_ Creatures that have not used magic this encounter are effectively invisible to the Ashcrawler — it must guess their location. Attacks against such creatures have disadvantage.
- _**Slam.** +8 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 2d10+5 bludgeoning. On a hit, the target makes a DC 15 Con save or is stunned until the end of their next turn.
- _**Plated Charge.**_ Once per encounter: the Ashcrawler charges up to 40 ft. in a line. Each creature in its path makes a DC 15 Dex save, taking 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a fail or half on a success.
- _**Chitin Armor.**_ The first time the Ashcrawler would take more than 15 damage from a single hit, reduce that damage by 10.
**Duskwing** _(formerly a large owl)_
A massive owl, wingspan stretching twelve feet, its feathers now the deep black-violet of the forest at its worst. The feathers at the wingtips have hardened into something resembling blades. It flies without disturbing the air — no downwash, no sound. Its call, when it makes one, is not a screech but a low resonant tone that rattles in the chest. It hunts from above and prefers to separate its prey from the group before striking.
_Behavior:_ Methodical and patient. It circles above the fog line and waits for a target to fall behind or be isolated. It will break off if it takes significant damage, retreat into the fog, and may return once — players should feel like it's watching even after it withdraws.
- **AC:** 14 | **HP:** 78 | **Speed:** 10 ft. / fly 60 ft.
- **CR:** 4
- _**Silent Flight.**_ The Duskwing makes no sound while flying. It cannot be heard and does not trigger opportunity attacks caused by sound detection.
- _**Isolation Strike.**_ If the Duskwing attacks a creature that has no ally within 10 ft., the attack deals an additional 2d6 damage and the target must make a DC 13 Wis save or be frightened until the end of their next turn.
- _**Talon Rake.** +6 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 2d6+4 slashing. On a hit, the target's movement speed is reduced by 10 ft. until the end of their next turn (blade-feather cuts).
- _**Resonance Call (1/Day).**_ The Duskwing emits its deep tone. Each creature within 30 ft. makes a DC 13 Con save or is incapacitated until the end of their next turn as the sound disrupts their focus.
- _**Fade and Return.**_ If the Duskwing takes 20 or more damage in a single turn, it retreats into the fog. It may return at the start of the next round on a roll of 4–6 (d6), arriving from a different direction.
**How to run the encounter:**
- Give the party a moment of warning — a sound, a shadow, a feeling — before the beast fully reveals itself
- Michael will engage if necessary but defers to the players — this is their job
- Luna will heal and support, staying behind cover
- John will fight — efficiently, without flourish, and noticeably well for someone of his stated rank
- Emmet will find the nearest large tree and stay behind it. He will not be useful. He will be apologetic about this afterward.
- After the fight, if John performed well, Michael will quietly note it to whoever is nearest — "he always does that"
**How performance affects camp:**
- _Strong performance_ (the party handled it cleanly, protected the escort targets, made smart decisions): The training request happens at camp
- _Acceptable performance_ (they won but it was messy): Michael considers it — the request may happen but with less certainty, or only if a specific player stood out
- _Poor performance_ (escort targets were endangered, players made reckless decisions): No training request. Michael and Luna are quieter at camp. John says nothing.
**Achievements available:**
- _Beast Slayer_ — Defeat the mutated beast
- _Not a Scratch_ — Complete the encounter with no escort target taking damage
- _Identify the Hunt_ — Correctly identify the creature's behavior pattern and exploit it
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player uses a creative or unexpected solution rather than straight damage
- A player specifically positions themselves to protect Emmet without being asked
- A player notices John fighting and comments on it in character
- Someone makes a decision that's genuinely funny or genuinely daring mid-combat

## Event 3 — Camp in the Twilight Forest

_Type: Rest / Roleplay_
The group stops to make camp just off the road — not far, just enough to get clear of the immediate sightlines. The fog has thinned slightly but not gone. The forest glimmers around them in the dark, violet light pulsing faintly from the bark and undergrowth. It is, objectively, a beautiful place to sleep in. Nobody is fully comfortable.
A fire is made. Watches are assigned. Food is shared — Emmet has brought more than expected and insists on contributing, which is the most useful he has been all day.
**NPC behavior at camp:**
- **Michael** sits close to the fire, relaxed, seemingly at ease. He is the kind of person who has learned to rest when rest is available. He will talk to anyone who approaches him, and his questions tend to be genuine rather than polite.
- **Luna** stays busy — checks equipment, tends to any injuries, then eventually settles down and becomes more talkative the longer the night goes on. She is chattier in the dark than she is on the road.
- **John** eats, says little, and watches the treeline. He will answer direct questions with direct answers and nothing more. He is not unfriendly — he just doesn't volunteer.
- **Emmet** is quietly processing the day. He checks on the Duskbloom several times to make sure they survived the journey intact. He will talk about Sera if anyone asks, at length, with the slightly dazed expression of someone who still can't quite believe the afternoon in Lowfield happened.
**Conversation prompts — things NPCs may ask players:**
- _Michael to anyone:_ "What brought you to this kind of work? Guide licensing isn't the most obvious path."
- _Michael to anyone:_ "Do you believe the Hero will be found? Genuinely — not the Church line. What do you think?"
- _Luna to anyone she's warmed to:_ "Do you ever get scared? On a job like this, I mean. Or does it stop bothering you eventually?"
- _Luna to anyone:_ "Where are you going after Caldenveil? Or is this just — one job at a time?"
- _John if directly asked about himself:_ "I'm here to do the work. That's all." — but if pushed genuinely: "I had something I needed to be closer to. The Church put me in the right direction."
- _Emmet to anyone who sits near him:_ "Can I ask you something? When you do something terrifying — does it ever start to feel normal? Or does it always feel like the first time?"
**The training request (conditional — strong/acceptable performance only):**
After camp has settled and the fire has burned lower, Michael approaches whichever player performed best in the beast encounter — or the group as a whole if the performance was collectively strong. He is direct about it, no preamble:
_"John trains alone. He always has. I've been trying to find the right moment to suggest he work with someone who can push back. Would any of you be willing to spar with him — properly — tomorrow, or along the road?"_
If players agree, John doesn't object. He doesn't look pleased either. He just nods once and goes back to watching the treeline.
If players ask why John doesn't train with Michael or Luna: Michael smiles quietly. _"He's already past what I can offer him in that regard. Luna would heal him before he learned anything. He needs someone who'll hit him back."_
**John's late-night training:**
Regardless of how camp goes, sometime in the deep of the night — during a watch change or a quiet moment — John slips away from camp into the forest. He doesn't go far. The sounds of controlled movement, the muffled impact of strikes against a tree, the quiet rhythm of someone who has done this every night for years, drift back faintly.
- A player on watch has the highest chance of noticing — DC 12 Perception
- A player who is awake for any reason can also roll
- If noticed: the player can observe quietly, follow him, or wake someone. John will not stop if approached — he'll acknowledge the player with a look and keep going. If asked why: _"I sleep better after."_
- If nobody notices: describe the faint sounds to the table in the morning briefing — "at some point in the night, you may have heard something" — and let them piece it together
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player has a genuine, unscripted conversation with an NPC that goes somewhere unexpected
- A player shares something real about their character's motivations unprompted
- A player follows John into the forest and just — trains with him, without making it a scene
- A player comforts Emmet about the day in a way that feels earned
- Someone asks Michael about Arthur — he'll deflect warmly, but reward the instinct

## Event 4 — Something Off the Road

_Type: Exploration / Atmosphere (Chance — triggers only if players leave the road or investigate)_
This event does not happen automatically. It requires the players to make a choice — to leave the road or follow something into the trees. Pick one of the triggers below based on what fits the session, or let player curiosity do the work naturally.
**Possible triggers:**
- _The glint:_ Emmet notices something catching the violet light between the trees — too regular to be bark, too still to be a creature. He mentions it quietly, not sure if it's worth saying anything.
- _The sound:_ One player hears something faint and rhythmic deeper in the forest. Not threatening — almost musical, like wind moving through something hollow. It doesn't repeat if they stop to listen. It starts again when they walk.
- _The animal:_ A small creature — something that was once a fox, now with an extra pair of legs and fur the color of twilight — darts off the road ahead of them and stops twenty feet into the trees. It looks back. Then moves again, slowly, like it is waiting.
- _The feeling:_ No trigger — a player simply decides to leave the road and investigate the forest. The others may follow or not.
**If they follow:**
The fog thickens almost immediately — not gradually, but in distinct steps, as if responding to their movement. The trees grow older and more widely spaced the further they go. The undergrowth is wrong in a way that's hard to articulate: things growing that have no business growing here, in colors that don't exist in normal forests.
Then the trees open into a clearing.
At the far edge of it, half-swallowed by the Twilight Forest's creeping vegetation but unmistakably intact, is a house. Wooden, hand-built, carefully made. A covered porch. A cleared practice area in front. The trees around it are dark and strange but the clearing itself is — still. Quiet in a way the rest of the forest is not. The fog does not enter the clearing.
The party can see it clearly from the tree line. They cannot get closer.
**The fog barrier:**
As players move toward the clearing, the fog thickens along the path ahead — not dramatically, not with sound or force, but with a kind of absolute certainty. Visibility drops to zero in the direction of the house. Players who push into it feel — not threatened, not in pain — but deeply, instinctively unwelcome. Like walking into a room that belongs to someone and knowing it the moment you cross the threshold. Most players will stop on their own. If a player pushes through regardless, they emerge on the other side of the fog patch still at the treeline — as if the fog has simply redirected them without their noticing.
**What they can see from the treeline:**
- The house is intact and maintained — not a ruin
- The door is closed but there is no lock visible
- There are no lights inside
- The practice area in front shows signs of recent use — disturbed earth, the impression of footwork patterns in the ground
- The vegetation around the clearing stops at a clean, unnatural line — as if something has told it not to cross
Nobody lives there. Or — nobody is there right now.
**DM note:** Do not name the house. Do not explain it. Let players speculate. If Michael sees it, he goes very still and says nothing. If pressed, he says quietly: _"We should keep moving."_ He doesn't look back.
**Achievements available:**
- _Off the Beaten Path_ — Leave the road and discover the clearing

## The Feeling That Follows

_Triggered after the clearing, lasts until Lowfield_
Whether or not the players found the cabin, something changes in the forest after Event 4. The party begins to notice — gradually, then unmistakably — that something is behind them.
It is not subtle. Branches shift in their wake in a pattern that doesn't match the wind. The fog moves around something that isn't visible. Perception checks confirm it: something large, something aware, something that is keeping exact pace with the group without closing the distance.
It does not attack. It does not make a sound. But it is there, and it knows they know, and it doesn't care.
**How to run it:**
- Describe it in increments — the first sign is easy to dismiss, the second less so, the third is undeniable
- Let players decide how to respond: ignore it, try to confront it, move faster, set a trap
- If they try to confront it: the fog shifts, something moves — large, definitely larger than anything they fought earlier — and then it is simply not where it was. It is behind them again.
- If they set a trap: the trap triggers on nothing. Whatever it is, it was not where they thought it was.
- John's jaw tightens. He does not draw his weapon. He keeps walking.
- Michael watches the treeline for a long moment, then faces forward again. His expression is unreadable.
**When they reach Lowfield:**
The moment the first player steps past the tree line into the open ground approaching Lowfield, the presence stops. Not gradually — immediately. The fog thins. The forest behind them is still. Whatever was following them is gone, and has been gone since the tree line, as if it simply ceased at the border.
Nobody says anything about it. Nobody needs to.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player tries something genuinely creative to identify or confront the presence
- A player notices John's reaction and comments on it in character
- A player is the last one to step out of the forest and pauses at the tree line to look back — reward that instinct

## Lowfield — Rest Stop

_Type: Rest / Character / Atmosphere_
Lowfield hits differently after the Twilight Forest. The lane is unpaved and quiet, the houses are small, chickens wander freely, and somewhere nearby someone is baking bread. It is aggressively, almost stubbornly normal. After what the party just walked through, normal is disorienting in the best possible way.
Michael exhales when they arrive — genuinely, visibly. Luna immediately starts talking at full volume again, like someone who has been holding it in. John looks at the village for a long moment, something unreadable crossing his face, and then says nothing. Emmet starts smiling and doesn't stop.
The party has time. Let them use it however they want. The moments below can happen in any order, or not at all — follow where players go.

## Moment — Edna's Cafe

Edna knows they're coming before they arrive. Word travels fast in Lowfield and a group of six escorts plus an Archbishop is not something that goes unnoticed on the lane. By the time the party reaches the cafe, there is already food on the counter.
She feeds them first and asks questions second — that is simply how she operates. The food is good. Better than good. After two days in the Twilight Forest it is almost aggressively comforting.
Edna will talk to anyone who lets her. She is warm, sharp, and completely unintimidated by anyone at the table. If players ask about the village she answers easily — the farms, the families, the weather, who is feuding with whom over a fence line. She does not bring up the war. She does not bring up demons. If players bring it up themselves she pauses, then says simply: _"Nothing bad comes here. Never has, even now. We don't ask why. We just count ourselves lucky."_ Then she moves on.
On the wall behind the counter, among other small things, is a hand-drawn sketch in a simple frame. It shows a boy — maybe twelve — sitting on the bench outside the cafe, eating something. The drawing is old, the edges worn. The boy in it looks exactly like he could have sat down yesterday.
Edna does not point it out. She does not mention it unless asked. If a player notices and asks who it is, she looks at it for a moment with an expression that is warm and a little complicated: _"A boy who used to come through with his father. Years ago now."_ She does not say more unless pushed. If pushed further: _"He had a sweet tooth something terrible. I always made sure there was something ready."_ She does not say his name.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player notices the sketch on their own without being prompted
- A player asks Edna about the village's safety and genuinely listens to her non-answer
- A player just sits quietly and eats without doing anything — reward the rest

## Moment — The Millstone

Benno has rooms ready. He always has rooms ready — it is simply what he does. He doesn't make a fuss about the party's arrival, just checks them in efficiently and shows them where things are. The rooms are clean. The beds are real beds. After the forest floor this is remarkable.
If players linger in the common room, Benno will be there — not hovering, just present. He keeps busy. He is not a gossip and does not ask questions about where they've been or where they're going. But he pays attention. If a player looks worn down he will quietly set something warm in front of them without comment.
At some point during the stay, if any player is up late or wanders downstairs, they may notice: one of the three rooms upstairs has its door slightly ajar, and inside it is clearly not being used for storage or guests. The bed is made with particular care. There is nothing in the room except furniture — no personal effects, no decoration — but it is maintained like it matters. If a player asks Benno about it he pauses in what he's doing and says: _"That room's taken."_ He does not explain. He does not seem to think further explanation is required.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player notices the reserved room and follows up with Benno
- A player thanks Benno genuinely — not just in passing — and he actually looks up from what he's doing

## Moment — The Lane

The village lane is exactly what it looks like: a quiet unpaved road, gardens on either side, neighbors occasionally calling to each other across it. There is nothing suspicious here. There is nothing wrong. It is just a village that is fine, in a world where villages are not supposed to be fine anymore.
If players walk the lane they may notice, without being told to look: there are no abandoned houses. Every building is occupied, every garden is tended. In the broader world, villages this size have lost a third of their population to raids or evacuation. This one hasn't lost anyone. The community stockpile in the old barn at the edge of the pasture — visible through the open doors if players pass it — is quietly enormous for a village this size, neatly organized, and clearly added to regularly. Nobody seems to be in charge of it. It simply exists.
An older farmer — Renwick, if players encounter him — will answer questions about the village in the fewest possible words. He is not evasive, just economical. If players ask directly why Lowfield has been untouched by the war, he looks at them for a long moment and says: _"Don't know. Thought about it. Don't know."_ Then, after a pause: _"There was a man used to come through here. Him and his boy. Good man. Real quiet. Forest type."_ He does not continue unless asked. If asked: _"Haven't seen him in a long time. Boy neither."_ He picks up whatever he was doing. The conversation is over unless players reopen it.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player puts the stockpile, the intact houses, and Renwick's comment together and says something about it out loud
- A player asks Renwick a follow-up question about the man and his boy and actually sits down to hear the answer

## Moment — Emmet in Lowfield

Emmet is having the best day he has had in months. He knows this village — he has been here before, that one afternoon with Sera — and being back in it makes him happy in a slightly overwhelming way. He keeps stopping to look at things. The bench outside Edna's cafe. The spot at the pasture market where Sera's cart was parked. The lane itself.
If any player walks with him, he will talk. Not about Sera specifically — he is trying to play it cool and failing — but about the afternoon they met. The way she explained the pricing of preserved goods to him like it was fascinating rather than commercial. The fact that she laughed at something he said and he still isn't sure if it was at him or with him but he chooses to believe with him. The way she looked when she was packing up her cart to leave.
He stops at one point and looks at the pasture market and says, half to himself: _"I've never done anything brave before. In my whole life. Yesterday was the first time."_ He clearly means the forest, the flowers, the asking. He does not seem to realize he has said this out loud until a beat later, when he looks slightly embarrassed. _"Anyway."_
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player walks the lane with Emmet without being asked to
- A player responds to Emmet's accidental admission in a way that is kind without being condescending

## Act 1 Finale — The Demon General Mimic

_Type: Ambush / Forced Retreat — End of Act 1_
After leaving Lowfield the road changes. The Twilight Forest is behind them. The unnamed forest between here and Caldenveil is ordinary — quiet, green, light behaving as light should. The mood lifts. The worst of the journey is over. Caldenveil is ahead. Let this breathe for a moment. The party needs to feel safe before it stops being safe.

## Version A — Emmet is with the party

The road is easy and the conversation is good. Emmet has been walking with more confidence than he has shown all trip — there's an energy to him that wasn't there in the Twilight Forest, something lighter. He keeps touching the inside of his coat where the Duskbloom are wrapped.
Then he sees it. Just off the path, close enough to reach in under a minute — one final Duskbloom, growing alone at the base of a tree. The last one he needs to complete the bundle.
He looks at the party. He looks at the flower. He looks at the party again.
_"It's right there. I'll just — one second. I'll be right back."_
He doesn't wait for permission. He crosses the short distance with the slightly undignified speed of someone trying to look casual while doing something they're excited about. He crouches. Gets the flower free without damaging it. Stands.
He turns around to face the party. He holds the flower up. He has the complete bundle in his other hand. He is grinning — genuinely, fully, the expression of someone who cannot believe their own luck and is not trying to hide it. He opens his mouth to say something —
A pitch black blade erupts from his chest.
It came from directly behind him. From a shadow that was not there a moment ago. The Demon General Mimic has been there the entire time — patient, still, waiting for exactly this: a turned back, a moment of joy, a split second of absolute inattention.
Emmet looks down at the blade. He is still holding the flowers. He does not drop them.
The Mimic withdraws the blade and steps back. Emmet falls.
**Saving Emmet:**
He is alive but will not be for long without help. A player must reach him, stabilize him, and get him moving — at minimum one action to stabilize and someone to support his weight. Luna can assist if players are moving rather than fighting.
- Stabilized and carried within 3 rounds: Emmet survives, gravely wounded, unconscious — still holding the flowers when they pry them from his hand
- Not reached in time: Emmet dies in the road with the complete bundle in his hands

## Version B — Emmet is not with the party

The road is quiet. Ordinary forest on both sides. Then a girl emerges from the trees ahead — young, maybe fifteen, clearly injured, clutching her arm and moving unevenly. She looks at the party like someone who has been running for a very long time.
She points — not forward, but behind the party. Back the way they came.
_"There are monsters. Back there. In the trees. They're coming."_
Then she collapses.
**The inconsistency:**
The party came from that direction. They saw nothing. Players who stop to think — why is she pointing behind them, why did they not encounter anything from that direction, why did she emerge from the opposite side of the road — can make a DC 13 Insight or Perception check to register that something is wrong.
If nobody flags it, Luna is already moving. She is crouching beside the girl, hands glowing with healing light, before anyone has finished processing the scene. It is exactly what Luna does. It is not a mistake — it is who she is.
As the light reaches the girl, her hand shifts. The fingers elongate, darken, fuse — and a pitch black blade drives up into Luna's side.
Luna makes no sound. She just — stops. And then lists sideways.
**Luna's condition:**
Incapacitated. Breathing, but cannot cast, cannot move under her own power, will not stabilize without immediate healing from another source. She needs to be carried. Every round she goes without healing, her condition worsens.
The Mimic drops the disguise. What stands up is vast and wrong and has been patient for a long time

## Fight or Flight

_The moment after Vael'shar reveals itself and Michael steps forward_
The party has three options: rescue the wounded, stay and fight, or run. Michael's order is to run. What the party does is up to them — but every path eventually leads to the same place: cornered, outmatched, and John holding a box that has never opened for anyone.

## Option 1 — Rescue

The party's priority is getting to Emmet or Luna before worrying about anything else. This is largely player-driven — how they move, who covers who, whether they succeed in time. Wing this based on the table.
The key tension: every round spent on rescue is a round not running. Vael'shar is occupied with Michael, but Michael will not hold indefinitely. The rescue window is real but it is closing.
Once the wounded are stabilized and moving, the party is still in the same situation — they need to run, and Vael'shar will eventually be behind them.

## Option 2 — Stay and Fight

They can try. Vael'shar will let them try for exactly long enough to make the point.
The first player to attack gets a response — one strike, precise and contemptuous, that deals enough damage to make the gap in capability undeniable. Vael'shar does not follow up. It returns its attention to Michael as if the player has already been accounted for.
If the party persists: Michael will not say it again. He said run. Whether they listened is on them. Eventually, when Michael goes down or the damage becomes untenable, the party will run anyway — just worse off than if they had gone immediately.
Wing the specifics. The point is not to kill players, it is to make the correct decision obvious in hindsight.

## Option 3 — Run

The party can run in two directions: toward Caldenveil, or back toward Lowfield. Both paths lead to the same outcome — Michael is killed — but they play out differently.
**Running toward Caldenveil:**
The party moves fast. The sounds of the fight behind them are enormous and then, at a point they can't precisely identify, stop. Not a conclusion. Just silence.
Vael'shar is not immediately behind them — but it will be. It finishes what it came for first. The party has a window: keep running, or hide.
- _Keep running:_ They may reach Caldenveil's gates before Vael'shar catches up. The gates, the guards, the city — these change the calculation for Vael'shar. It is not gone, but it chooses not to follow into a populated, defensible location. For now.
- _Hide:_ DC 18 Stealth as a group. On a success, Vael'shar passes by — they can hear it moving, feel the wrongness of its presence in the air, and then it is gone. On a failure, it finds them.
**Running toward Lowfield:**
Vael'shar does not follow toward Lowfield. The party does not know why. It kills Michael, and then it simply does not pursue in that direction. The forest road back to the village is clear.
_DM Note: Vael'shar knows what Lowfield is. It knows who protects it. It will not go there._
In either direction, if Vael'shar catches up before the party reaches safety, it is not immediately lethal — it wants the Hero's Box, which it now suspects one of them may be carrying or may be connected to. It will hurt them. It will demand it. And then John opens the box.

## The Box Opens

This triggers when a player tells John to try the box — in a moment of desperation, as a last idea, because there is nothing else left to try.
John has been told before. Michael told him, more than once, in the way Michael tells people things — gently, with patience, without pressure. John always said no. He didn't see himself as anything the box would respond to.
He picks it up now because someone asked and because there is nothing else.
The box does not glow. It does not make a sound. It simply — opens. Like it was never locked. Like it has been waiting for exactly this.
Inside is nothing that looks like a weapon. A small mark — a seal, a sigil, something that has no immediate name — lifts from the interior of the box as if it were always meant to go somewhere. It finds John's hand. It burns in, slow and deliberate, like something being written rather than branded. John makes no sound. His expression is unreadable.
Then the mark flares.
The light that comes from it is not like Luna's healing light or Michael's divine condemnation. It is quieter than that, and somehow worse — a focused, personal radiance that has no interest in illuminating anything except its target. It hits Vael'shar like a weight. Not an explosion. Not a beam. Just — pressure, and heat, and the specific quality of something that recognizes what Vael'shar is and has decided it is not welcome here.
Vael'shar is wounded. Not critically. Not enough to change what it is. But it steps back — and for a creature that has never needed to step back from anything the party has seen, the sight of it doing so lands hard.
It looks at John for a long moment.
Then it leaves. No words. No threat. It simply turns and is gone, folding back into shadow and road and the ordinary-looking forest, and the silence it leaves behind is the most unsettling thing about the whole encounter. A creature like that does not retreat to regroup. It retreats because it has learned something. And it will act on what it learned.
John stares at the mark on his hand for a long moment. The box is empty now — whatever was inside it is part of him. He closes his hand slowly.
Nobody says anything. There is nothing to say yet.
**What the mark is:**
The mark is John's Hero Candidate seal — the Goddess's acknowledgment that this person has the potential to become a Hero. It is not a power grant. It is a recognition. The power that came from it was John's own, expressed through the seal for the first time, raw and uncontrolled and enough.

**Achievements available:**
- _Against the Odds_ — Arrive at Caldenveil with all living party members and escort targets intact
- _We Don't Leave People_ — Stay to fight despite everything, even briefly, before retreating
- _Fast Hands_ — Stabilize Emmet before he dies _(Version A only)_
- _Something Was Wrong_ — Flag the inconsistency before Luna acts _(Version B only)_
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player's immediate reaction to the Mimic reveal — fear, rage, a terrible joke, complete silence — is genuinely memorable
- A player says something to Michael before running — anything at all
- A player looks back while running
- Someone reaches Caldenveil and just sits down on the ground without saying a word
