Will is an internal energy that exists within living beings, drawn from one's conviction, identity, and understanding of self. Unlike magic, which is external and learned, Will is intrinsic — it cannot be taught, only awakened. It manifests differently in every individual and is shaped entirely by who that person is.
**Stage I — Manifestation**
- The user becomes aware of their Will and begins to express it outwardly
- Enhances the user's physical abilities and weapon, taking on a general elemental or conceptual form (e.g. fire, wind, shadow, stone)
- The form is broad and instinctual — the user does not yet fully understand it
**Stage II — Awakening**
- The user comes to understand the true nature of their Will
- The broad form sharpens into something personal and distinct through introspection and often a defining moment of clarity
- Example: Fire → Explosions, Lasers, Burning Away Impurity, or even Healing through Renewal
- No two Awakenings are exactly the same, even if two users began with the same manifestation
**Stage III — Realization**
- The user realizes their Will fully onto themselves and the world
- They do not merely wield their Will — they embody it
- The user transcends the original form, wielding the underlying concept in its purest expression
- Example: Explosion Will → can detonate anything. Light Will → the user becomes light itself
**DM Notes**
- Will is a spectrum. Many fighters never reach Manifestation. Awakening is rare. Realization is near-mythical.
- Will and magic are distinct systems and do not interfere with each other, though a user can theoretically possess both.
- Will is unique to this world. Other worlds may have analogous systems (Qi, Aura, etc.) but the specific stages and expression of Will are native to this setting only.
