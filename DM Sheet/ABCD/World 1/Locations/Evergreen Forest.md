# Evergreen Forest / Twilight Forest

A dense forest that runs between Stonewood and Lowfield, bisected by a single road connecting the two. In the Past it is known as the Evergreen Forest. After Arthur's death, Tristan's grief and awakening power permanently altered the environment — the forest changed color, changed atmosphere, changed nature. It has been known as the Twilight Forest ever since. The road through it still exists but is no longer considered safe.

## 🕯️ PRESENT — The Twilight Forest

The Twilight Forest is not simply dark. It is wrong in a way that is difficult to articulate. The trees still stand. Things still grow. But the colors are off — deep purples, bruised blues, blacks where there should be green. The light that filters through the canopy is dim and strange, like perpetual dusk regardless of the hour. Animals exist here but they are not the animals of the Evergreen Forest. What lives in the Twilight Forest has adapted to it, and most of it is hostile.
Travelers who must cross between Stonewood and Lowfield do so quickly and in groups. The road is still passable but the forest presses close on either side and things move in the treeline. No one who has wandered off the road has returned with a full account of what they found. The Church has declared the forest cursed. Scholars call it a permanent magical anomaly. Neither explanation satisfies anyone who has actually been inside it.
Demons do not patrol the forest but they do not need to. The forest does the work for them.

## 🌄 PAST — The Evergreen Forest

The Evergreen Forest is beautiful, but not simply so. The trees are old and very tall, their canopy thick enough that the light reaches the forest floor in long, slanted beams. It is quiet in the way that deep places are quiet — not empty, but listening. Animals move through it freely. The undergrowth is dense but not threatening. The road through it is well-traveled and safe enough, though travelers who stray from it tend to find themselves turned around in ways that feel less like bad luck and more like the forest deciding.
There is an undercurrent to it that most people register without naming. Something about the Evergreen Forest feels inhabited in a way that goes beyond its wildlife. It is not frightening. But it is aware.
Arthur has lived here long enough to know every sound the forest makes. Tristan has grown up in it. To both of them it is simply home.

## Key Locations

## The Road

_Present:_ The single unpaved road connecting Stonewood and Lowfield still cuts through the Twilight Forest, but it is no longer a comfortable journey. The road is intact but the forest crowds it from both sides, close enough that branches overhang the path. Travelers report sounds from the treeline — movement, breathing, something that stops when you stop walking. The journey that once took a relaxed half-day now feels much longer. Most people move fast and don't look into the trees.
_Past:_ A well-maintained dirt road through pleasant woodland. Merchants use it regularly. Locals walk it without a second thought. Arthur and Tristan use it on their trips to Stonewood and Lowfield, usually with a cart of game. It passes close enough to their home that Arthur can cut through the forest from a familiar point rather than going all the way to the road's end.

## Arthur and Tristan's House

_Location:_ Deep in the forest, well off the road and invisible from it. Arthur built it by hand when he first retired — a sturdy wooden structure, not large, but carefully made. A main room with a fireplace, two small bedrooms, a covered porch, and a cleared patch of ground outside that serves as both a practice area and a place to sit in the evenings. The surrounding trees were chosen deliberately — old growth, widely spaced, the kind that let in enough light to make the place feel open even deep in the forest.
_Present:_ The forest around the house has been overtaken by the Twilight Forest's changes — the trees have darkened, strange vegetation has crept up the outer walls, and the clearing is rimmed with the same bruised, unnatural growth that defines the rest of the forest. But the house itself has been preserved. By order of Tristan, nothing in the immediate area of the house is to be harmed or intruded upon. Demons and creatures that roam the Twilight Forest give the clearing a wide berth — they do not know why, they simply do. The door is unlocked. Inside, the house is maintained. Not pristine, but cared for — the fireplace has been used recently, there are signs that someone has slept here, sat here, eaten here alone. Personal items remain exactly where they were left. Arthur's things have not been moved. A second set of belongings — sparse, practical — indicates Tristan returns. How often is unclear. The house feels less like a ruin and more like a wound that hasn't closed.
_Past:_ Warm and lived-in. The main room smells of woodsmoke and whatever Arthur has been cooking. Training equipment is stacked near the door. Tristan's small collection of things he has found in the forest — smooth stones, interesting bark, a feather — sits on the windowsill. The porch is where Arthur tends to sit in the evenings. It is a genuinely happy place, in the quiet way of people who have made peace with a simple life and mean it.

## Story Notes (DM Only)

- The transformation of the Evergreen Forest into the Twilight Forest is the most visible mark Tristan's grief left on the world — players in the Present phase who know what the forest used to be (from the Past phase) will feel the weight of it
- The house is Tristan's one act of preservation in a world he has spent twenty years reshaping through war — finding it should tell players something important about who he still is underneath everything
- If players reach the house in the Present phase, the undisturbed state of Arthur's belongings is a potential emotional moment — Tristan has not removed them, has not been able to
- The clearing's enforced safety is a hook: players who are being pursued through the Twilight Forest might stumble into it and find themselves inexplicably protected — and then have to reckon with why
- In the Past phase, the house is a place players may spend time in — it should feel like a real home, not a set piece
