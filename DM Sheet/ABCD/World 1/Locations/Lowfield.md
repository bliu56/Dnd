# Lowfield

A small, quiet farming village at the other end of the Evergreen Forest from Stonewood. The village sustains itself through farming, animal husbandry, and rural trade. Residents barter freely and sell surplus goods to passing merchants or make occasional trips to Stonewood. There are no walls, no guard. A few cafes and eateries serve as the social heart of the village.
Arthur and Tristan are regular visitors, coming to sell hunted game and pick up goods. They are warmly regarded — a sweet, quiet family everyone has a soft spot for. The village aunties have adopted Tristan as a collective source of joy. He never speaks to anyone in the village — he listens, nods, shakes his head, and accepts whatever is put in front of him with quiet contentment.
It was the aunties' offhand comments — _"I wish he'd stay this cute forever"_ — that Tristan took literally. Somewhere between intention and instinct, he used his demon magic to halt his own growth. He still looks twelve. He may always look twelve.

## 🕯️ PRESENT

Lowfield should not exist in its current state. Villages like it have been raided or abandoned. But Lowfield stands — farms tended, cafes open, smoke rising from chimneys. No demon has come within a mile of it. No soldier has ridden through demanding grain. The kingdom's army has tried twice and been turned back both times by things that can't quite be explained. The villagers count their blessings and keep farming. The older residents who remember Arthur and Tristan have their suspicions. They don't say them out loud.

## 🌄 PAST

Lowfield is unhurried, warm, and deeply communal. Market days are social events as much as commercial ones. Edna's cafe has the best bread within fifty miles and she knows it. Farmers argue about weather and soil. Children chase livestock through the lanes. Arthur and Tristan's visits are minor local events — word spreads fast and by the time they reach the main lane, aunties are already emerging from doorways with something warm to press into Tristan's hands.

## Key Locations

## The Village Lane

_Present:_ The main unpaved road through the heart of Lowfield, lined with farmhouses, small gardens, and handmade signs advertising eggs or wool for trade. Quieter than it used to be — a few houses sit empty. But the lane is swept, the gardens are tended, and smoke comes from most chimneys.
_Past:_ Busy and sociable. Neighbors call out across the lane. Chickens wander freely. The smell of baking bread drifts from Edna's cafe at all hours. Children use the lane as a race track. A cart is almost always parked somewhere it shouldn't be.

## Edna's Cafe

_Location:_ A low, wide building near the center of the village lane with a hand-painted sign that reads "Edna's" and a bench out front almost always occupied by someone with nowhere pressing to be. Four tables, a long wooden counter, and a kitchen that takes up more than half the space.
_Present:_ Edna is still there. Still baking. The menu hasn't changed in twenty years and she considers this a point of pride. The cafe has become an anchor for the village — people come not just for the food but because it feels like proof that things are still normal. She refuses to raise prices even as ingredients cost more, making up the difference by growing what she can and accepting barter.
- Fresh bread (loaf) — 3cp or barter
- Hot meal (changes daily) — 5cp or barter
- Tea or herbal drink — 1cp
- Pastry — 2cp
_Past:_ The best-smelling building in the village on any given day. Always full around mealtimes. Edna is behind the counter, opinionated about everything, generous to a fault with portions. Tristan is her particular favorite — he gets the largest slice of whatever is fresh without ever asking. She has never once heard him say thank you and has never once minded.
- Fresh bread (loaf) — 2cp or barter
- Hot meal — 3cp or barter
- Tea or herbal drink — 1cp
- Pastry — 1cp
**Edna — NPC**
_Present — Edna, age 68_
- Has run the cafe for forty years and plans to run it forty more
- One of the oldest residents and one of the few who openly says she thinks the village is being watched over
- Keeps a small sketch of Tristan on the wall behind her counter that a traveling artist made years ago — he still looks exactly the same in it, which she finds more comforting than strange
- Feeds anyone who comes through her door regardless of whether they can pay
- The emotional center of the village — if Edna is calm, everyone is calm
- _Personality at the table:_ Warm, sharp, completely unintimidated by anyone. Will feed players before asking a single question. Knows more than she lets on about why Lowfield has been spared.
_Past — Edna, age 48_
- In her prime and running the cafe at full tilt
- Has adopted Tristan as her personal project — always has something ready for him, always pretends it's nothing special
- The one who first said _"I wish he'd stay this cute forever"_ — she has no idea what she started
- Knows Arthur is not quite a normal retired farmer but has never asked and never intends to
- _Personality at the table:_ Loudly cheerful, impossible to refuse, always three steps ahead of the conversation. Will have already heard why the players are in Lowfield before they tell her.

## The Millstone — Inn

_Location:_ A sturdy two-story stone building at the edge of the village, named for the old millstone propped against its outer wall. Ground floor is a common room and small kitchen. Upper floor has three rooms.
_Present:_ Runs at half capacity — fewer traveling merchants come through now that the roads are less safe. Benno keeps the place immaculate out of habit and quiet pride. He has converted one of the three rooms into village emergency supplies — food, medicine, blankets — organized and maintained without being asked.
- Private room — 4sp per night
- Common room meal — 5cp
- Ale — 3cp per pint
- Stabling — 2sp per night
_Past:_ A comfortable, unhurried inn with steady business from traveling merchants. Benno always keeps Arthur and Tristan's usual room available without being asked — a habit that started after the third time Arthur arrived to find it taken.
- Private room — 3sp per night
- Common room meal — 3cp
- Ale — 2cp per pint
- Stabling — 1sp per night
**Benno — NPC**
_Present — Benno, age 55_
- Has run the Millstone his whole adult life, inherited it from his parents
- Quietly converted one room into a village emergency supply depot without announcing it to anyone
- Mentally tracks who in the village needs what and makes sure it happens without fanfare
- Still keeps Arthur's old usual room available. Has for twenty years. Doesn't explain why when asked.
- _Personality at the table:_ Calm, methodical, deeply kind in a practical way. Not a gossip. Will not share information about guests without a very good reason. Players who stay and treat the inn with respect will find him an unexpectedly valuable ally.
_Past — Benno, age 35_
- A steady, reliable innkeeper who takes quiet pride in running a good house
- Has a soft spot for Arthur and Tristan — always has their room ready, always has something extra on the tray
- Never asks Arthur about his past. Has pieced together more than he lets on from small details over the years.
- _Personality at the table:_ Friendly and accommodating without being effusive. Remembers how you take your tea after one visit.

## The Pasture & Farm Market

_Location:_ An open field at the northern edge of the village that doubles as an informal market on certain days. No stalls, no fees, no rules — people spread things out on carts and blankets and sort it out among themselves.
_Present:_ Still running, still informal. The variety is smaller but what's here is good. A few farmers have quietly started setting aside a portion of each harvest in the old barn at the edge of the pasture. Nobody organized this. It just happened. The village is preparing, in its quiet way, for something it doesn't want to name.
- Seasonal produce — barter or 1–2cp per item
- Livestock (chickens, goats) — barter or negotiated
- Eggs — 1cp per half dozen
- Wool and hides — barter or negotiated
_Past:_ Lively and social. As much a community gathering as a market. Arthur sells his hunted game here and is always surrounded by people wanting to hear about the forest. Tristan stands beside him, accepting whatever food people press into his hands, listening to conversations he has no intention of joining.
- All of the above plus hunted game (when Arthur is in town) — barter or negotiated
**Renwick — NPC**
_Present — Renwick, age 72_
- One of the oldest farmers in Lowfield, has worked the same land his entire life
- Knew Arthur as well as anyone in Lowfield did — respected him, never pried, shared ale with him on the bench outside the Millstone on warm evenings
- Has noticed that nothing bad ever happens to Lowfield and has a quiet theory about why — will share it with players who earn his trust slowly and patiently
- Quietly organizes the emergency supply stockpile without taking credit for it
- _Personality at the table:_ Few words, direct, unimpressed by status or urgency. Rush him and you get nothing. Sit down and let him talk at his own pace and you get everything.
_Past — Renwick, age 52_
- A hardworking farmer in his prime, respected by the whole village
- One of Arthur's few genuine peers in Lowfield — they don't talk much but there's a mutual recognition between them
- Has let Tristan help on the farm a few times. Tristan works hard and silently and Renwick appreciates both enormously.
- _Personality at the table:_ Gruff but fair. Generous with work and stingy with words. Warms up considerably after the second ale.

## Story Notes (DM Only)

- Lowfield is Tristan's emotional anchor — the place that represents everything Arthur taught him about living among people, being known, being cared for
- His protection of Lowfield in the Present is entirely personal and entirely silent — no demons know why they are not to go near it, they just know
- Players in the Present phase may notice that Lowfield is inexplicably untouched and begin to ask why — a thread that leads directly to understanding who Tristan really is beneath the Demon King
- Edna's sketch of Tristan — unchanged after twenty years — is a potential story moment if players notice it
- Renwick's quiet theory about the village's protection could seed Tristan's identity before players have figured it out themselves
- Tristan halting his own growth is an early sign of how powerful his magic truly is — he changed something fundamental about himself half by accident as a child
