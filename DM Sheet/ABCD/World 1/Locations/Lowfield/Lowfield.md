A small, quiet farming village at the other end of the Evergreen Forest from Stonewood. The village sustains itself through farming, animal husbandry, and rural trade. Residents barter freely and sell surplus goods to passing merchants or make occasional trips to Stonewood. There are no walls, no guard. A few cafes and eateries serve as the social heart of the village.
Arthur and Tristan are regular visitors, coming to sell hunted game and pick up goods. They are warmly regarded — a sweet, quiet family everyone has a soft spot for. The village aunties have adopted Tristan as a collective source of joy. He never speaks to anyone in the village — he listens, nods, shakes his head, and accepts whatever is put in front of him with quiet contentment.
It was the aunties' offhand comments — _"I wish he'd stay this cute forever"_ — that Tristan took literally. Somewhere between intention and instinct, he used his demon magic to halt his own growth. He still looks twelve. He may always look twelve.

## 🕯️ PRESENT

Lowfield should not exist in its current state. Villages like it have been raided or abandoned. But Lowfield stands — farms tended, cafes open, smoke rising from chimneys. No demon has come within a mile of it. No soldier has ridden through demanding grain. The kingdom's army has tried twice and been turned back both times by things that can't quite be explained. The villagers count their blessings and keep farming. The older residents who remember Arthur and Tristan have their suspicions. They don't say them out loud.

## 🌄 PAST

Lowfield is unhurried, warm, and deeply communal. Market days are social events as much as commercial ones. Edna's cafe has the best bread within fifty miles and she knows it. Farmers argue about weather and soil. Children chase livestock through the lanes. Arthur and Tristan's visits are minor local events — word spreads fast and by the time they reach the main lane, aunties are already emerging from doorways with something warm to press into Tristan's hands.
