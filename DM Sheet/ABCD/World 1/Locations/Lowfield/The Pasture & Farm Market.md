_Location:_ An open field at the northern edge of the village that doubles as an informal market on certain days. No stalls, no fees, no rules — people spread things out on carts and blankets and sort it out among themselves.
_Present:_ Still running, still informal. The variety is smaller but what's here is good. A few farmers have quietly started setting aside a portion of each harvest in the old barn at the edge of the pasture. Nobody organized this. It just happened. The village is preparing, in its quiet way, for something it doesn't want to name.
- Seasonal produce — barter or 1–2cp per item
- Livestock (chickens, goats) — barter or negotiated
- Eggs — 1cp per half dozen
- Wool and hides — barter or negotiated
_Past:_ Lively and social. As much a community gathering as a market. Arthur sells his hunted game here and is always surrounded by people wanting to hear about the forest. Tristan stands beside him, accepting whatever food people press into his hands, listening to conversations he has no intention of joining.
- All of the above plus hunted game (when Arthur is in town) — barter or negotiated
**Renwick — NPC**
_Present — Renwick, age 72_
- One of the oldest farmers in Lowfield, has worked the same land his entire life
- Knew Arthur as well as anyone in Lowfield did — respected him, never pried, shared ale with him on the bench outside the Millstone on warm evenings
- Has noticed that nothing bad ever happens to Lowfield and has a quiet theory about why — will share it with players who earn his trust slowly and patiently
- Quietly organizes the emergency supply stockpile without taking credit for it
- _Personality at the table:_ Few words, direct, unimpressed by status or urgency. Rush him and you get nothing. Sit down and let him talk at his own pace and you get everything.
_Past — Renwick, age 52_
- A hardworking farmer in his prime, respected by the whole village
- One of Arthur's few genuine peers in Lowfield — they don't talk much but there's a mutual recognition between them
- Has let Tristan help on the farm a few times. Tristan works hard and silently and Renwick appreciates both enormously.
- _Personality at the table:_ Gruff but fair. Generous with work and stingy with words. Warms up considerably after the second ale.
