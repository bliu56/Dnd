A sturdy two-story stone building at the edge of the village, named for the old millstone propped against its outer wall. Ground floor is a common room and small kitchen. Upper floor has three rooms.

## 🕯️ Present

Runs at half capacity — fewer traveling merchants come through now that the roads are less safe. Benno keeps the place immaculate out of habit and quiet pride. He has converted one of the three rooms into village emergency supplies — food, medicine, blankets — organized and maintained without being asked.

## Benno — NPC

### 🕯️ Present — Benno, age 55

- Has run the Millstone his whole adult life, inherited it from his parents
- Quietly converted one room into a village emergency supply depot without announcing it to anyone
- Mentally tracks who in the village needs what and makes sure it happens without fanfare
- Still keeps Arthur's old usual room available. Has for twenty years. Doesn't explain why when asked.
- _Personality at the table:_ Calm, methodical, deeply kind in a practical way. Not a gossip. Will not share information about guests without a very good reason. Players who stay and treat the inn with respect will find him an unexpectedly valuable ally.

### 🌄 Past — Benno, age 35

- A steady, reliable innkeeper who takes quiet pride in running a good house
- Has a soft spot for Arthur and Tristan — always has their room ready, always has something extra on the tray
- Never asks Arthur about his past. Has pieced together more than he lets on from small details over the years.
- _Personality at the table:_ Friendly and accommodating without being effusive. Remembers how you take your tea after one visit.
