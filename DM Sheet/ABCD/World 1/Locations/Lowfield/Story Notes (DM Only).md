- Lowfield is Tristan's emotional anchor — the place that represents everything Arthur taught him about living among people, being known, being cared for
- His protection of Lowfield in the Present is entirely personal and entirely silent — no demons know why they are not to go near it, they just know
- Players in the Present phase may notice that Lowfield is inexplicably untouched and begin to ask why — a thread that leads directly to understanding who Tristan really is beneath the Demon King
- Edna's sketch of Tristan — unchanged after twenty years — is a potential story moment if players notice it
- Renwick's quiet theory about the village's protection could seed Tristan's identity before players have figured it out themselves
- Tristan halting his own growth is an early sign of how powerful his magic truly is — he changed something fundamental about himself half by accident as a child
