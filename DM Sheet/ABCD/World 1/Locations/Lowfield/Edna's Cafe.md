_Location:_ A low, wide building near the center of the village lane with a hand-painted sign that reads "Edna's" and a bench out front almost always occupied by someone with nowhere pressing to be. Four tables, a long wooden counter, and a kitchen that takes up more than half the space.
_Present:_ Edna is still there. Still baking. The menu hasn't changed in twenty years and she considers this a point of pride. The cafe has become an anchor for the village — people come not just for the food but because it feels like proof that things are still normal. She refuses to raise prices even as ingredients cost more, making up the difference by growing what she can and accepting barter.
- Fresh bread (loaf) — 3cp or barter
- Hot meal (changes daily) — 5cp or barter
- Tea or herbal drink — 1cp
- Pastry — 2cp
_Past:_ The best-smelling building in the village on any given day. Always full around mealtimes. Edna is behind the counter, opinionated about everything, generous to a fault with portions. Tristan is her particular favorite — he gets the largest slice of whatever is fresh without ever asking. She has never once heard him say thank you and has never once minded.

**Edna — NPC**
_Present — Edna, age 68_
- Has run the cafe for forty years and plans to run it forty more
- One of the oldest residents and one of the few who openly says she thinks the village is being watched over
- Keeps a small sketch of Tristan on the wall behind her counter that a traveling artist made years ago — he still looks exactly the same in it, which she finds more comforting than strange
- Feeds anyone who comes through her door regardless of whether they can pay
- The emotional center of the village — if Edna is calm, everyone is calm
- _Personality at the table:_ Warm, sharp, completely unintimidated by anyone. Will feed players before asking a single question. Knows more than she lets on about why Lowfield has been spared.
_Past — Edna, age 48_
- In her prime and running the cafe at full tilt
- Has adopted Tristan as her personal project — always has something ready for him, always pretends it's nothing special
- The one who first said _"I wish he'd stay this cute forever"_ — she has no idea what she started
- Knows Arthur is not quite a normal retired farmer but has never asked and never intends to
- _Personality at the table:_ Loudly cheerful, impossible to refuse, always three steps ahead of the conversation. Will have already heard why the players are in Lowfield before they tell her.
