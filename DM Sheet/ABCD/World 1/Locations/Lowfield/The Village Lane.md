## 🕯️ Present

The main unpaved road through the heart of Lowfield, lined with farmhouses, small gardens, and handmade signs advertising eggs or wool for trade. Quieter than it used to be — a few houses sit empty. But the lane is swept, the gardens are tended, and smoke comes from most chimneys.

## 🌄 Past

Busy and sociable. Neighbors call out across the lane. Chickens wander freely. The smell of baking bread drifts from Edna's cafe at all hours. Children use the lane as a race track. A cart is almost always parked somewhere it shouldn't be.
