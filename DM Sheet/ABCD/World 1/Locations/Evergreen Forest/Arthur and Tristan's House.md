Deep in the forest, well off the road and invisible from it. Arthur built it by hand when he first retired — a sturdy wooden structure, not large, but carefully made. A main room with a fireplace, two small bedrooms, a covered porch, and a cleared patch of ground outside that serves as both a practice area and a place to sit in the evenings. The surrounding trees were chosen deliberately — old growth, widely spaced, the kind that let in enough light to make the place feel open even deep in the forest.

## 🕯️ Present

The forest around the house has been overtaken by the Twilight Forest's changes — the trees have darkened, strange vegetation has crept up the outer walls, and the clearing is rimmed with the same bruised, unnatural growth that defines the rest of the forest. But the house itself has been preserved. By order of Tristan, nothing in the immediate area of the house is to be harmed or intruded upon. Demons and creatures that roam the Twilight Forest give the clearing a wide berth — they do not know why, they simply do. The door is unlocked. Inside, the house is maintained. Not pristine, but cared for — the fireplace has been used recently, there are signs that someone has slept here, sat here, eaten here alone. Personal items remain exactly where they were left. Arthur's things have not been moved. A second set of belongings — sparse, practical — indicates Tristan returns. How often is unclear. The house feels less like a ruin and more like a wound that hasn't closed.

## 🌄 Past

Warm and lived-in. The main room smells of woodsmoke and whatever Arthur has been cooking. Training equipment is stacked near the door. Tristan's small collection of things he has found in the forest — smooth stones, interesting bark, a feather — sits on the windowsill. The porch is where Arthur tends to sit in the evenings. It is a genuinely happy place, in the quiet way of people who have made peace with a simple life and mean it.
