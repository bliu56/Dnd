# Story Notes (DM Only)

- The transformation of the Evergreen Forest into the Twilight Forest is the most visible mark Tristan's grief left on the world — players in the Present phase who know what the forest used to be (from the Past phase) will feel the weight of it
- The house is Tristan's one act of preservation in a world he has spent twenty years reshaping through war — finding it should tell players something important about who he still is underneath everything
- If players reach the house in the Present phase, the undisturbed state of Arthur's belongings is a potential emotional moment — Tristan has not removed them, has not been able to
- The clearing's enforced safety is a hook: players who are being pursued through the Twilight Forest might stumble into it and find themselves inexplicably protected — and then have to reckon with why
- In the Past phase, the house is a place players may spend time in — it should feel like a real home, not a set piece
