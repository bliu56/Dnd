A dense forest that runs between Stonewood and Lowfield, bisected by a single road connecting the two. In the Past it is known as the Evergreen Forest. After Arthur's death, Tristan's grief and awakening power permanently altered the environment — the forest changed color, changed atmosphere, changed nature. It has been known as the Twilight Forest ever since. The road through it still exists but is no longer considered safe.

## 🕯️ PRESENT — The Twilight Forest

The Twilight Forest is not simply dark. It is wrong in a way that is difficult to articulate. The trees still stand. Things still grow. But the colors are off — deep purples, bruised blues, blacks where there should be green. The light that filters through the canopy is dim and strange, like perpetual dusk regardless of the hour. Animals exist here but they are not the animals of the Evergreen Forest. What lives in the Twilight Forest has adapted to it, and most of it is hostile.
Travelers who must cross between Stonewood and Lowfield do so quickly and in groups. The road is still passable but the forest presses close on either side and things move in the treeline. No one who has wandered off the road has returned with a full account of what they found. The Church has declared the forest cursed. Scholars call it a permanent magical anomaly. Neither explanation satisfies anyone who has actually been inside it.
Demons do not patrol the forest but they do not need to. The forest does the work for them.

## 🌄 PAST — The Evergreen Forest

The Evergreen Forest is beautiful, but not simply so. The trees are old and very tall, their canopy thick enough that the light reaches the forest floor in long, slanted beams. It is quiet in the way that deep places are quiet — not empty, but listening. Animals move through it freely. The undergrowth is dense but not threatening. The road through it is well-traveled and safe enough, though travelers who stray from it tend to find themselves turned around in ways that feel less like bad luck and more like the forest deciding.
There is an undercurrent to it that most people register without naming. Something about the Evergreen Forest feels inhabited in a way that goes beyond its wildlife. It is not frightening. But it is aware.
Arthur has lived here long enough to know every sound the forest makes. Tristan has grown up in it. To both of them it is simply home.
