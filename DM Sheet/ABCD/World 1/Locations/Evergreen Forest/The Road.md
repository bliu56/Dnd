## 🕯️ Present

The single unpaved road connecting Stonewood and Lowfield still cuts through the Twilight Forest, but it is no longer a comfortable journey. The road is intact but the forest crowds it from both sides, close enough that branches overhang the path. Travelers report sounds from the treeline — movement, breathing, something that stops when you stop walking. The journey that once took a relaxed half-day now feels much longer. Most people move fast and don't look into the trees.

## 🌄 Past

A well-maintained dirt road through pleasant woodland. Merchants use it regularly. Locals walk it without a second thought. Arthur and Tristan use it on their trips to Stonewood and Lowfield, usually with a cart of game. It passes close enough to their home that Arthur can cut through the forest from a familiar point rather than going all the way to the road's end.
