# Stonewood

A walled trade city situated at the edge of the Evergreen Forest, serving as the main hub between the surrounding towns and villages. Large enough to have a permanent Church presence, a busy market, and a professional city guard, but small enough that most long-time residents know each other by face if not by name.

## 🕯️ PRESENT

_20 years after the Demon King's return_
Stonewood's walls still stand. Its market still runs. The Church bells still ring on schedule. To a traveler passing through, it might seem like a city carrying on — resilient, even admirable. But spend a night here and something else becomes clear. The laughter is too quiet. The market stalls close earlier than they used to. People don't linger in the streets after dark. The Church is full not because of faith but because people have nowhere else to put their fear.
The war with the Demon King has not touched Stonewood's walls directly, but it has touched everything inside them. Refugees from smaller destroyed villages have swelled the population. Food is rationed quietly — not by law yet, but by the invisible hand of scarcity. The city guard has tripled in size but halved in morale. Crime has risen in the alleys the guard doesn't bother to patrol anymore. The Church preaches hope but the pews feel more like a shelter than a sanctuary. Stonewood is a city holding its breath.

## 🌄 PAST

_The era of peace following the Demon King's defeat_
Stonewood is a city that feels like a deep breath. The war is over, the Hero won, and the world is rebuilding. Trade flows freely through Stonewood's gates — merchants from distant towns, traveling craftsmen, pilgrims visiting the Church to give thanks. The market is loud and colorful. Children run between stalls. The guard is bored in the best possible way. The Church is well-attended out of genuine gratitude rather than desperation. The walls exist more as tradition than necessity — the gates are rarely fully closed. The city feels open, warm, and unhurried.

## Key Locations

## The Gate & Walls

_==Present==:_ The walls are a patchwork of old and new stonework — the newer sections darker, rougher, clearly added in haste during the early years of the war. Watchtowers have been installed at regular intervals along the battlements. The gatehouse is staffed by six guards at minimum with a sergeant present at all times. Travelers are questioned and bags are checked. Refugees are funneled to a separate processing area outside the eastern gate where they can wait days for entry. A notice board at the gate lists contraband items — the list has grown long.
_==Past==:_ The city walls are old but well-maintained — a point of civic pride. The gatehouse is staffed by two guards at most, and familiar faces are waved through with a nod. Merchants shout greetings as they pass. The gates close at sundown more out of habit than necessity. The whole structure feels more like a landmark than a fortification.
==**Captain Aldric — The Guard**==
_==Present== — Aldric, age 48, Captain_
- Rose through the ranks as older captains retired or died in the war's early chaos
- His wife Elara died of illness seven years ago. His son Cael joined the war effort eight months ago and he hasn't heard back.
- Runs the guard with iron efficiency. No tolerance for infractions. The warmth is buried deep.
- Privately knows the guard cannot hold the city if the Demon King's forces actually arrive — he is managing fear, not preventing disaster
- Has quietly authorized the guard to ignore Thornside Alley entirely — a decision that haunts him
- _Personality at the table:_ All business. Will cooperate with capable, legitimate players. Mention Cael at your own risk — it's the one crack in the armor.
_==Past== — Aldric, age 28, Sergeant_
- A young sergeant who takes his job seriously but doesn't have much to do in peacetime
- Patrols are quiet. His biggest concern is the occasional drunk merchant.
- Believes in law and protecting people — idealistic but not naive
- Has a wife named Elara and a newborn son named Cael. Talks about them constantly.
- _Personality at the table:_ Friendly and approachable. Will chat with travelers, ask where they're headed, and share a local tip or two.

## The Church of the Goddess

_==Present==:_ The largest building in the city, built from pale stone that glows faintly in the morning light. Inside, the pews are packed at all hours — families sleeping in the aisles, refugees huddled in side chapels. The Bishop delivers loud, urgent sermons about divine protection and endurance. The Church has become the city's de facto refugee processing center, food distribution point, and grief counseling office all at once. The staff is stretched thin and exhausted. The doors never close because there are always people who have nowhere else to go. The atmosphere is heavy — desperate prayers, quiet weeping, the smell of too many people in too small a space.
_==Past==:_ The largest building in the city, built from pale stone that catches the morning light beautifully. The interior is open and airy with tall windows and wooden pews worn smooth from decades of use. Services are joyful community events — singing, shared meals afterward, a genuine sense of gratitude for the peace the world has won. The resident Priest, Father Cedric, knows every family in the city by name. The doors are open from dawn to dusk and the atmosphere inside is warm, quiet, and welcoming.

## The Market District

_==Present==:_ A wide cobblestone square lined with stalls and surrounded by shop fronts. Half the original vendors have been replaced by refugees selling whatever they managed to carry out of their destroyed homes — secondhand tools, worn clothing, small personal items. Exotic goods are nearly gone. What remains is practical: food, basic supplies, cheap medicine. Prices have crept up on everything and nobody pretends otherwise. The atmosphere is transactional and tense. Vendors watch their stock carefully. Pickpocketing is common enough that most people keep a hand on their coin purse. The market closes an hour before sunset and the square empties fast — nobody wants to be caught outside after dark.
_==Past==:_ A wide cobblestone square that is the beating heart of the city. Loud, colorful, and fragrant — spices from the south, bolts of cloth from the east, fresh produce from surrounding farms piled high on wooden carts. Street performers work the crowd. Vendors argue cheerfully with each other over shared corners. Children chase each other between the legs of adults. The smell of roasting meat drifts from a corner stall that always has a line. The market runs from sunrise to an hour before sunset and the square stays lively long after it officially closes.

## Gareth's Smithy

_Location:_ A squat stone building near the city's northern gate, identifiable by the permanent haze of smoke above it and the rhythmic clang of hammer on anvil that starts before dawn. A wooden sign above the door reads "Gareth & Son."
_==Present==:_ The smithy runs day and night. The forge never fully cools. The interior is cluttered with weapon racks, half-finished orders, and scraps of metal covering every surface. The air is thick with heat and the smell of iron. Gareth himself is usually at the anvil, sleeves rolled up, face set in concentration. He speaks only when spoken to and even then keeps it short. The wait list for orders is pinned to the door — currently three weeks out.
- Longswords — 15gp
- Short swords — 10gp
- Spearheads (unhandled) — 4gp
- Chain shirt repairs — 5gp per session
- Arrowheads (bundle of 20) — 3gp
- Shields (iron-banded wood) — 8gp
- ⚠️ Custom orders suspended.
_==Past==:_ A tidy, well-organized smithy with tools hung neatly on the walls and a workbench clear enough to eat off. The forge burns steadily but not urgently. Gareth works at his own pace, chatting with customers, letting his apprentice Pip try his hand at simpler work under supervision. The shop smells of iron and sawdust. A stool by the door is usually occupied by whoever stopped in to talk.
- Farming tools (shovels, hoes, plough fittings) — 5sp each
- Horseshoes (set of 4) — 8sp
- Hunting knives — 1gp
- Basic iron cookware — 2–4sp
- Simple iron locks — 3sp
- Custom orders accepted, 1 week turnaround
==**Gareth — NPC**==
_==Present== — Gareth, age 50_
- The warmth has been worn out of him by two decades of weapon orders
- Has made more swords and spearheads in the last five years than in his entire previous career
- His apprentice Pip died in a village raid two years ago. The sign still says "& Son."
- Works from before dawn until after dark. Speaks little. Charges fair prices but no longer enjoys the work.
- Holds a quiet resentment toward the Church for not doing more but would never say it out loud
- _Personality at the table:_ Curt and efficient. Not unkind, just done with pleasantries. Will warm up slightly if players treat him with genuine respect or mention Pip.
_==Past== — Gareth, age 30_
- A broad, cheerful man who inherited the smithy from his father
- Known for honest prices and quality work — takes pride in everything that leaves his shop
- Teaching his apprentice Pip with genuine patience and obvious fondness
- Spends his evenings at the Hearthstone. Laughs loudly. Tips well.
- Has never made a weapon more serious than a hunting sword and is quietly proud of that
- _Personality at the table:_ Warm and unhurried. Happy to chat. Will throw in a free sharpening if he likes you.

## Mara's Stall

_Location:_ A corner stall in the market square, one of the few with a permanent wooden canopy. In the Present the canopy is weathered and patched with a handwritten price board at the front and a locked strongbox under the counter.
_==Present==:_ The stall is smaller than it looks like it used to be — the edges of the canopy show old attachment points where extensions once hung. Stock is practical and sparse: root vegetables, preserved meats, dried medicinal herbs. Mara stands behind the counter with the posture of someone who has been on her feet for twenty years and intends to stay there. She watches the square constantly — old habit, new purpose.
- Basic root vegetables and grain — 3cp per item
- Dried herbs (medicinal, limited) — 1sp per bundle
- Salted preserved meats — 5cp per portion
- Information — price negotiable
- ⚠️ Stock varies day to day. Exotic goods no longer available.
_==Past==:_ The stall is impossible to walk past — bright cloth draped over the canopy, dried flowers hanging from the frame, the smell of spices hitting you from ten feet away. Mara is usually mid-conversation with someone, gesturing enthusiastically over a pile of produce. Tomas works the back of the stall, restocking and quietly keeping track of everything his wife gives away for free to people she likes.
- Fresh seasonal produce — 1–3cp per item
- Dried herbs and cooking spices — 2–5cp per bundle
- Imported pepper and saffron — 5sp per pouch
- Honey (local) — 4cp per jar
- Wildflower bundles — 1cp
==**Mara — NPC**==
_==Present== — Mara, age 45_
- Tomas was killed when their village supply route was raided three years ago. Mara kept the stall because she had to.
- Still knows everyone's business but doesn't share it freely — information has value and she has learned that the hard way
- The warmth is still there but buried under exhaustion and grief. It has to be earned.
- _Personality at the table:_ Guarded at first. Opens up if players are respectful and spend coin. Once trusted, becomes one of the best information sources in the city — she sees everything from that corner.
_==Past== — Mara, age 25_
- Runs the stall with her husband Tomas, who handles restocking while she handles everyone else
- Loud, friendly, and impossible to walk past without stopping — the city's unofficial gossip hub
- Knows everyone's business and shares most of it freely and cheerfully
- Genuinely happy. Believes the world is good and says so often.
- _Personality at the table:_ Will call out to players as they pass, offer a free sample, and already know something interesting about wherever they came from.

## The Gatehouse

_Location:_ A two-story stone structure built into the city walls flanking the southern gate.
_==Present==:_ The interior has been converted into a full operations room. A large map of the surrounding region covers one wall, marked with pins indicating known demon activity and raided settlements. Guard rosters are posted beside it. The warm fire and casual atmosphere are long gone — this is a working command post. Captain Aldric is usually here when not on patrol, standing over the map with the expression of a man doing math he doesn't like the answer to.
_==Past==:_ The gatehouse interior is simple and comfortable — a guard post that doubles as a welcome point. There's usually a pot of something warm on the fire, a deck of cards on the table, and at least one guard asleep in a chair. Sergeant Aldric runs a tight enough ship but sees no reason to make his men miserable about it.
**Captain Aldric — NPC**
_==Present== — Aldric, age 48, Captain_
- Rose through the ranks as older captains retired or died in the war's early chaos
- His wife Elara died of illness seven years ago. His son Cael joined the war effort eight months ago and he hasn't heard back.
- Runs the guard with iron efficiency. No tolerance for infractions. The warmth is buried deep.
- Privately knows the guard cannot hold the city if the Demon King's forces actually arrive — he is managing fear, not preventing disaster
- Has quietly authorized the guard to ignore Thornside Alley entirely — a decision that haunts him
- _Personality at the table:_ All business. Will cooperate with capable, legitimate players. Mention Cael at your own risk — it's the one crack in the armor.
_==Past== — Aldric, age 28, Sergeant_
- A young sergeant who takes his job seriously but doesn't have much to do in peacetime
- Patrols are quiet. His biggest concern is the occasional drunk merchant.
- Believes in law and protecting people — idealistic but not naive
- Has a wife named Elara and a newborn son named Cael. Talks about them constantly.
- _Personality at the table:_ Friendly and approachable. Will chat with travelers, ask where they're headed, and share a local tip or two.

## Thornside Alley

_Location:_ A maze of narrow streets and cramped courtyards behind the market district, sandwiched between the backs of merchant buildings and the city's inner wall.
_==Present==:_ Thornside is now a dense, self-contained district that the city guard has quietly abandoned. Refugees have built lean-tos and partition walls between existing buildings, turning alleyways into corridors and courtyards into common rooms. Unlicensed vendors operate openly. There are at least two underground fighting rings, an unlicensed apothecary rumored to sell Church-banned substances, and an information brokering network operating out of a former cooperage at the far end of the main lane. It is not openly dangerous if you carry yourself right, but it is not safe either.
- Black market goods — negotiated
- Forged documents and travel papers — negotiated
- Information brokering — negotiated
- Unlicensed healing — negotiated
- Unofficial passage out of the city — negotiated
_==Past==:_ A narrow alley district of secondhand shops, cheap lodgings, and the occasional unlicensed card game. Mildly shady but nothing serious — the kind of place that has a reputation slightly worse than it deserves. The guard does a sweep twice a day and everyone tidies up accordingly.
==**Silas — NPC**==
_==Present== — Silas, age 42_
- The unofficial boss of Thornside Alley, running a network of smugglers, information brokers, and refugee fixers
- Not evil — genuinely helps desperate people, always at a price
- Has an uneasy truce with Captain Aldric: Silas keeps Thornside from boiling over, Aldric looks the other way
- Found in the back room of the former cooperage at the end of Thornside's main lane — you have to know to ask for him by name
- _Personality at the table:_ Calm, measured, sharply intelligent. Respects competence. Hates wasted time. Fair prices, always. Never does anything for free.
_==Past== — Silas, age 22_
- A small-time con artist running rigged games and short-changed trades in the market and Thornside
- Charming and quick-witted. Hard to dislike even when you know what he is.
- Has a loose network of street contacts and knows where things can be found for the right price
- Found at the back tables of the Hearthstone or near the market's east entrance
- _Personality at the table:_ Friendly and slippery. Will pretend to be something he isn't until pushed. Responds well to directness and coin. Has a good sense of humor about being caught out.

## The Hearth Inn

_Location:_ A two-story timber-framed building on the western edge of the market square. The ground floor is the common room and kitchen, the upper floor has eight rooms. A painted hearthstone above the door is said to have been blessed by a traveling priest decades ago.
_==Present==:_ The Hearthstone is overcrowded and showing its age. Rooms have been subdivided — what were private quarters now sleep three or four. The common room is full every night but not with celebration; it is the low murmur of people with nowhere else to go, nursing cheap ale and avoiding eye contact. The kitchen serves one hot meal a day and it runs out fast. The painted hearthstone above the door has become an impromptu shrine — small offerings of coins and flowers left at its base by guests who need something to believe in.
- Shared room (3–4 per room) — 4sp per night
- Private room (rare) — 1gp per night
- Common room meal — 8cp
- Ale — 5cp per pint
- Wine — 2sp per cup
- Stabling — 4sp per night
- ⚠️ Fully booked most nights. Arrive early or know someone.
_==Past==:_ The Hearthstone is lively and welcoming, the natural endpoint of any good day in Stonewood. The common room smells of roasting meat and woodsmoke. A local bard plays on weekend evenings. Travelers swap stories over ale. The innkeeper, a stout woman named Bess, knows every guest's name by morning and has an opinion about all of them. Rooms are clean, private, and fairly priced.
- Private room (single) — 5sp per night
- Private room (double) — 8sp per night
- Common room meal — 3cp
- Ale — 2cp per pint
- Wine (local) — 5cp per cup
- Stabling — 2sp per night
