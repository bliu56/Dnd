# The Hearth Inn

_Location:_ A two-story timber-framed building on the western edge of the market square. The ground floor is the common room and kitchen, the upper floor has eight rooms. A painted hearthstone above the door is said to have been blessed by a traveling priest decades ago.
_==Present==:_ The Hearthstone is overcrowded and showing its age. Rooms have been subdivided — what were private quarters now sleep three or four. The common room is full every night but not with celebration; it is the low murmur of people with nowhere else to go, nursing cheap ale and avoiding eye contact. The kitchen serves one hot meal a day and it runs out fast. The painted hearthstone above the door has become an impromptu shrine — small offerings of coins and flowers left at its base by guests who need something to believe in.

_==Past==:_ The Hearthstone is lively and welcoming, the natural endpoint of any good day in Stonewood. The common room smells of roasting meat and woodsmoke. A local bard plays on weekend evenings. Travelers swap stories over ale. The innkeeper, a stout woman named Bess, knows every guest's name by morning and has an opinion about all of them. Rooms are clean, private, and fairly priced.
