## 🕯️ Present

The walls are a patchwork of old and new stonework — the newer sections darker, rougher, clearly added in haste during the early years of the war. Watchtowers have been installed at regular intervals along the battlements. The gatehouse is staffed by six guards at minimum with a sergeant present at all times. Travelers are questioned and bags are checked. Refugees are funneled to a separate processing area outside the eastern gate where they can wait days for entry. A notice board at the gate lists contraband items — the list has grown long.

## 🌄 Past

The city walls are old but well-maintained — a point of civic pride. The gatehouse is staffed by two guards at most, and familiar faces are waved through with a nod. Merchants shout greetings as they pass. The gates close at sundown more out of habit than necessity. The whole structure feels more like a landmark than a fortification.

## Captain Aldric — The Guard

### 🕯️ Present — Aldric, age 48, Captain

- Rose through the ranks as older captains retired or died in the war's early chaos
- His wife Elara died of illness seven years ago. His son Cael joined the war effort eight months ago and he hasn't heard back.
- Runs the guard with iron efficiency. No tolerance for infractions. The warmth is buried deep.
- Privately knows the guard cannot hold the city if the Demon King's forces actually arrive — he is managing fear, not preventing disaster
- Has quietly authorized the guard to ignore Thornside Alley entirely — a decision that haunts him
- _Personality at the table:_ All business. Will cooperate with capable, legitimate players. Mention Cael at your own risk — it's the one crack in the armor.

### 🌄 Past — Aldric, age 28, Sergeant

- A young sergeant who takes his job seriously but doesn't have much to do in peacetime
- Patrols are quiet. His biggest concern is the occasional drunk merchant.
- Believes in law and protecting people — idealistic but not naive
- Has a wife named Elara and a newborn son named Cael. Talks about them constantly.
- _Personality at the table:_ Friendly and approachable. Will chat with travelers, ask where they're headed, and share a local tip or two.
