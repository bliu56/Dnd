# The Church of the Goddess

_==Present==:_ The largest building in the city, built from pale stone that glows faintly in the morning light. Inside, the pews are packed at all hours — families sleeping in the aisles, refugees huddled in side chapels. The Bishop delivers loud, urgent sermons about divine protection and endurance. The Church has become the city's de facto refugee processing center, food distribution point, and grief counseling office all at once. The staff is stretched thin and exhausted. The doors never close because there are always people who have nowhere else to go. The atmosphere is heavy — desperate prayers, quiet weeping, the smell of too many people in too small a space.
_==Past==:_ The largest building in the city, built from pale stone that catches the morning light beautifully. The interior is open and airy with tall windows and wooden pews worn smooth from decades of use. Services are joyful community events — singing, shared meals afterward, a genuine sense of gratitude for the peace the world has won. The resident Priest, Father Cedric, knows every family in the city by name. The doors are open from dawn to dusk and the atmosphere inside is warm, quiet, and welcoming.
