_Location:_ A corner stall in the market square, one of the few with a permanent wooden canopy. In the Present the canopy is weathered and patched with a handwritten price board at the front and a locked strongbox under the counter.
_==Present==:_ The stall is smaller than it looks like it used to be — the edges of the canopy show old attachment points where extensions once hung. Stock is practical and sparse: root vegetables, preserved meats, dried medicinal herbs. Mara stands behind the counter with the posture of someone who has been on her feet for twenty years and intends to stay there. She watches the square constantly — old habit, new purpose.
- Basic root vegetables and grain — 3cp per item
- Dried herbs (medicinal, limited) — 1sp per bundle
- Salted preserved meats — 5cp per portion
- Information — price negotiable
- ⚠️ Stock varies day to day. Exotic goods no longer available.
_==Past==:_ The stall is impossible to walk past — bright cloth draped over the canopy, dried flowers hanging from the frame, the smell of spices hitting you from ten feet away. Mara is usually mid-conversation with someone, gesturing enthusiastically over a pile of produce. Tomas works the back of the stall, restocking and quietly keeping track of everything his wife gives away for free to people she likes.
- Fresh seasonal produce — 1–3cp per item
- Dried herbs and cooking spices — 2–5cp per bundle
- Imported pepper and saffron — 5sp per pouch
- Honey (local) — 4cp per jar
- Wildflower bundles — 1cp
==**Mara — NPC**==
_==Present== — Mara, age 45_
- Tomas was killed when their village supply route was raided three years ago. Mara kept the stall because she had to.
- Still knows everyone's business but doesn't share it freely — information has value and she has learned that the hard way
- The warmth is still there but buried under exhaustion and grief. It has to be earned.
- _Personality at the table:_ Guarded at first. Opens up if players are respectful and spend coin. Once trusted, becomes one of the best information sources in the city — she sees everything from that corner.
_==Past== — Mara, age 25_
- Runs the stall with her husband Tomas, who handles restocking while she handles everyone else
- Loud, friendly, and impossible to walk past without stopping — the city's unofficial gossip hub
- Knows everyone's business and shares most of it freely and cheerfully
- Genuinely happy. Believes the world is good and says so often.
- _Personality at the table:_ Will call out to players as they pass, offer a free sample, and already know something interesting about wherever they came from.
