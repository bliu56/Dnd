# Gareth's Smithy

_Location:_ A squat stone building near the city's northern gate, identifiable by the permanent haze of smoke above it and the rhythmic clang of hammer on anvil that starts before dawn. A wooden sign above the door reads "Gareth & Son."
_==Present==:_ The smithy runs day and night. The forge never fully cools. The interior is cluttered with weapon racks, half-finished orders, and scraps of metal covering every surface. The air is thick with heat and the smell of iron. Gareth himself is usually at the anvil, sleeves rolled up, face set in concentration. He speaks only when spoken to and even then keeps it short. The wait list for orders is pinned to the door — currently three weeks out.

_==Past==:_ A tidy, well-organized smithy with tools hung neatly on the walls and a workbench clear enough to eat off. The forge burns steadily but not urgently. Gareth works at his own pace, chatting with customers, letting his apprentice Pip try his hand at simpler work under supervision. The shop smells of iron and sawdust. A stool by the door is usually occupied by whoever stopped in to talk.

==**Gareth — NPC**==
_==Present== — Gareth, age 50_
- The warmth has been worn out of him by two decades of weapon orders
- Has made more swords and spearheads in the last five years than in his entire previous career
- His apprentice Pip died in a village raid two years ago. The sign still says "& Son."
- Works from before dawn until after dark. Speaks little. Charges fair prices but no longer enjoys the work.
- Holds a quiet resentment toward the Church for not doing more but would never say it out loud
- _Personality at the table:_ Curt and efficient. Not unkind, just done with pleasantries. Will warm up slightly if players treat him with genuine respect or mention Pip.
_==Past== — Gareth, age 30_
- A broad, cheerful man who inherited the smithy from his father
- Known for honest prices and quality work — takes pride in everything that leaves his shop
- Teaching his apprentice Pip with genuine patience and obvious fondness
- Spends his evenings at the Hearthstone. Laughs loudly. Tips well.
- Has never made a weapon more serious than a hunting sword and is quietly proud of that
- _Personality at the table:_ Warm and unhurried. Happy to chat. Will throw in a free sharpening if he likes you.
