## 🕯️ Present

A wide cobblestone square lined with stalls and surrounded by shop fronts. Half the original vendors have been replaced by refugees selling whatever they managed to carry out of their destroyed homes — secondhand tools, worn clothing, small personal items. Exotic goods are nearly gone. What remains is practical: food, basic supplies, cheap medicine. Prices have crept up on everything and nobody pretends otherwise. The atmosphere is transactional and tense. Vendors watch their stock carefully. Pickpocketing is common enough that most people keep a hand on their coin purse. The market closes an hour before sunset and the square empties fast — nobody wants to be caught outside after dark.

## 🌄 Past

A wide cobblestone square that is the beating heart of the city. Loud, colorful, and fragrant — spices from the south, bolts of cloth from the east, fresh produce from surrounding farms piled high on wooden carts. Street performers work the crowd. Vendors argue cheerfully with each other over shared corners. Children chase each other between the legs of adults. The smell of roasting meat drifts from a corner stall that always has a line. The market runs from sunrise to an hour before sunset and the square stays lively long after it officially closes.
