_Location:_ A maze of narrow streets and cramped courtyards behind the market district, sandwiched between the backs of merchant buildings and the city's inner wall.
_==Present==:_ Thornside is now a dense, self-contained district that the city guard has quietly abandoned. Refugees have built lean-tos and partition walls between existing buildings, turning alleyways into corridors and courtyards into common rooms. Unlicensed vendors operate openly. There are at least two underground fighting rings, an unlicensed apothecary rumored to sell Church-banned substances, and an information brokering network operating out of a former cooperage at the far end of the main lane. It is not openly dangerous if you carry yourself right, but it is not safe either.

- Forged documents and travel papers — negotiated
- Information brokering — negotiated
- Unlicensed healing — negotiated
- Unofficial passage out of the city — negotiated
_==Past==:_ A narrow alley district of secondhand shops, cheap lodgings, and the occasional unlicensed card game. Mildly shady but nothing serious — the kind of place that has a reputation slightly worse than it deserves. The guard does a sweep twice a day and everyone tidies up accordingly.
==**Silas — NPC**==
_==Present== — Silas, age 42_
- The unofficial boss of Thornside Alley, running a network of smugglers, information brokers, and refugee fixers
- Not evil — genuinely helps desperate people, always at a price
- Has an uneasy truce with Captain Aldric: Silas keeps Thornside from boiling over, Aldric looks the other way
- Found in the back room of the former cooperage at the end of Thornside's main lane — you have to know to ask for him by name
- _Personality at the table:_ Calm, measured, sharply intelligent. Respects competence. Hates wasted time. Fair prices, always. Never does anything for free.
_==Past== — Silas, age 22_
- A small-time con artist running rigged games and short-changed trades in the market and Thornside
- Charming and quick-witted. Hard to dislike even when you know what he is.
- Has a loose network of street contacts and knows where things can be found for the right price
- Found at the back tables of the Hearthstone or near the market's east entrance
- _Personality at the table:_ Friendly and slippery. Will pretend to be something he isn't until pushed. Responds well to directness and coin. Has a good sense of humor about being caught out.
