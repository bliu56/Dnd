_Location:_ A two-story stone structure built into the city walls flanking the southern gate.
_==Present==:_ The interior has been converted into a full operations room. A large map of the surrounding region covers one wall, marked with pins indicating known demon activity and raided settlements. Guard rosters are posted beside it. The warm fire and casual atmosphere are long gone — this is a working command post. Captain Aldric is usually here when not on patrol, standing over the map with the expression of a man doing math he doesn't like the answer to.
_==Past==:_ The gatehouse interior is simple and comfortable — a guard post that doubles as a welcome point. There's usually a pot of something warm on the fire, a deck of cards on the table, and at least one guard asleep in a chair. Sergeant Aldric runs a tight enough ship but sees no reason to make his men miserable about it.
**Captain Aldric — NPC**
_==Present== — Aldric, age 48, Captain_
- Rose through the ranks as older captains retired or died in the war's early chaos
- His wife Elara died of illness seven years ago. His son Cael joined the war effort eight months ago and he hasn't heard back.
- Runs the guard with iron efficiency. No tolerance for infractions. The warmth is buried deep.
- Privately knows the guard cannot hold the city if the Demon King's forces actually arrive — he is managing fear, not preventing disaster
- Has quietly authorized the guard to ignore Thornside Alley entirely — a decision that haunts him
- _Personality at the table:_ All business. Will cooperate with capable, legitimate players. Mention Cael at your own risk — it's the one crack in the armor.
_==Past== — Aldric, age 28, Sergeant_
- A young sergeant who takes his job seriously but doesn't have much to do in peacetime
- Patrols are quiet. His biggest concern is the occasional drunk merchant.
- Believes in law and protecting people — idealistic but not naive
- Has a wife named Elara and a newborn son named Cael. Talks about them constantly.
- _Personality at the table:_ Friendly and approachable. Will chat with travelers, ask where they're headed, and share a local tip or two.
