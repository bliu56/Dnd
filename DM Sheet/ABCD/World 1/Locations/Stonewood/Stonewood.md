A walled trade city situated at the edge of the Evergreen Forest, serving as the main hub between the surrounding towns and villages. Large enough to have a permanent Church presence, a busy market, and a professional city guard, but small enough that most long-time residents know each other by face if not by name.

## 🕯️ PRESENT

_20 years after the Demon King's return_
Stonewood's walls still stand. Its market still runs. The Church bells still ring on schedule. To a traveler passing through, it might seem like a city carrying on — resilient, even admirable. But spend a night here and something else becomes clear. The laughter is too quiet. The market stalls close earlier than they used to. People don't linger in the streets after dark. The Church is full not because of faith but because people have nowhere else to put their fear.
The war with the Demon King has not touched Stonewood's walls directly, but it has touched everything inside them. Refugees from smaller destroyed villages have swelled the population. Food is rationed quietly — not by law yet, but by the invisible hand of scarcity. The city guard has tripled in size but halved in morale. Crime has risen in the alleys the guard doesn't bother to patrol anymore. The Church preaches hope but the pews feel more like a shelter than a sanctuary. Stonewood is a city holding its breath.

## 🌄 PAST

_The era of peace following the Demon King's defeat_
Stonewood is a city that feels like a deep breath. The war is over, the Hero won, and the world is rebuilding. Trade flows freely through Stonewood's gates — merchants from distant towns, traveling craftsmen, pilgrims visiting the Church to give thanks. The market is loud and colorful. Children run between stalls. The guard is bored in the best possible way. The Church is well-attended out of genuine gratitude rather than desperation. The walls exist more as tradition than necessity — the gates are rarely fully closed. The city feels open, warm, and unhurried.
