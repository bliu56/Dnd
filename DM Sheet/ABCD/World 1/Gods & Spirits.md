# Gods & Spirits

There are three powers that sit above the world without quite being part of it — the Goddess of Light, the God of Darkness, and the Spirit King. Each is vast enough that scholars argue about whether they are truly comparable, but in practice they occupy the same tier. None commands the others. None is known to have tried.

## Gods

The gods are distant. They do not walk the world, do not speak plainly, and do not intervene in ways that are easy to point to. Their presence is felt through the people and institutions that serve them — through the blessings they grant, the magic that flows from devotion to them, and the rare chosen individuals who carry their mandate into the world. When a god acts, it is almost always through someone else.
Whether this distance is a choice, a limitation, or something else entirely is a matter of ongoing theological debate that has never been resolved.
**Aelura** _**(ay-LOO-rah)**_ **— The Goddess of Light**
- The god of the Church, of heroes, of protection and order
- Her followers believe she actively cares about the world and its people — that her distance is patience, not indifference
- She chooses Heroes — individuals granted her blessing and mandate to act on her behalf at critical moments
- Divine magic drawn from her tends toward white and pale gold in appearance, structured and warm
- The Church is her primary institution, though not every person of faith operates through the Church
- Her relationship with Urathos is not explained in any text the Church acknowledges as authoritative. She has never, as far as anyone knows, spoken of him directly through any of her chosen.
**Urathos** _**(oo-RAH-thos)**_ **— The God of Darkness**
- Less understood and far less institutionalized than Aelura
- Has followers, but no single dominant organization comparable to the Church
- Is not universally considered evil — some traditions hold that darkness is simply the other half of what light is, neither lesser nor opposed
- His chosen, if he has them, are not publicly known or recognized as such
- Divine magic drawn from him tends toward deep blacks and cold silvers, quieter in appearance than light magic but no less potent
- The nature of his relationship with Aelura is one of the world's genuinely open questions. Scholars, priests, and philosophers have argued about it for centuries. The most honest answer is that no one knows — and any source that claims certainty is almost certainly projecting.
**Minor Gods under Aelura**
- **Vessa** _(VES-ah)_ — Goddess of Oaths & Contracts. Invoked when binding promises are made. Her name is used in formal vows and legal proceedings. Breaking an oath sworn in Vessa's name is considered one of the gravest acts a person can commit.
- **Calder** _(KAL-der)_ — God of Healing & Recovery. Patron of physicians, battlefield medics, and those who tend to the sick. Healers who draw divine magic often find it flows more readily when Calder is invoked.
- **Sorin** _(SOR-in)_ — God of Courage & Resolve. Soldiers whisper his name before a charge. Not a god of war — he governs the interior act of choosing to go forward when everything says to stop.
- **Lirien** _(LIR-ee-en)_ — Goddess of Mercy & Forgiveness. Invoked in last rites and in moments of clemency. Her worship is quiet and personal — she has no grand temples, only small shrines in the corners of churches and homes.
**Minor Gods under Urathos**
- **Vael** _(VAYL)_ — God of Secrets & Hidden Things. Worshipped by those who deal in information, by spies, and by those who must hide who they are. He does not judge what is concealed — only that it is concealed well.
- **Nara** _(NAH-rah)_ — Goddess of Grief & Memory. Not malevolent — she is the one who tends to the weight of loss. Mourners sometimes leave offerings at unmarked stones for her. She is considered the reason the dead are not forgotten.
- **Ossyr** _(OS-sir)_ — God of Endings & Thresholds. He governs the crossing between death and what comes after, not death itself. Distinct from violence or destruction — Ossyr is invoked at the close of things: the end of a journey, the last day of a life, the moment a door shuts for the final time.
- **Thessan** _(THES-an)_ — God of Ambition & Hunger. Patron of those who want more than they were given. Not inherently evil but his worship tends toward obsession. The Church considers him dangerous. His followers consider that the point.

## Spirits

Spirits are a separate category of being entirely. They are not gods and do not think of themselves as such. They are older presences — entities that have existed alongside the natural world for as long as the natural world has existed, each one tied to a specific element, place, or force. They do not govern in the way gods do. They simply are.
The Spirit King sits at the head of this hierarchy, roughly equal in scope and power to the major gods. He is not worshipped in the way gods are, but he is respected — by those who know enough to do so. His relationship with the Goddess and the God of Darkness is one of mutual recognition and apparent non-interference. There is no known conflict between the three powers, and no known alliance either.
**The Spirit King**
- The sovereign of all spirits, and the oldest of them
- Does not involve himself in human affairs as a rule, but is aware of them
- Humans who draw mana from spirits are, in a sense, drawing from a system that ultimately flows from him — though most casters never interact with him directly and many don't know he exists
- His appearance, nature, and motivations are largely unknown outside of spirit-affiliated traditions
**The Major Spirit Guardians**
- A tier of powerful spirits beneath the Spirit King, each governing a specific element
- They are not gods and do not grant divine magic — humans who draw from spirits are drawing ambient elemental mana, not receiving a blessing
- Each Guardian has a distinct character tied to their element. They can be communicated with, bargained with, and in rare cases form genuine bonds with human practitioners — but they are not warm in the way gods are imagined to be. They are elemental in the truest sense.
- There are four Major Spirit Guardians, each governing a primary element. They are ancient, distinct, and not easily categorized as benevolent or hostile — they are elemental in the truest sense, and interact with humans entirely on their own terms.

## Solrath — Guardian of Fire (SOL-rath)

_Appearance:_ A towering figure of condensed flame, shifting between the shape of a man and something far older. His face is calm in the way a wildfire is calm — not still, but inevitable.
_Personality:_ Proud, direct, and intensely present. Solrath does not waste words and does not tolerate timidity. He respects those who act with conviction, even if he disagrees with the action. He has a dry, sharp humor that surfaces unexpectedly. Of the four Guardians he is the most likely to engage with humans on something resembling equal footing — not because he thinks they are equals, but because he finds them interesting when they stop being afraid of him.
_What he values:_ Courage, decisiveness, and honesty. No patience for hesitation or false modesty. Responds well to people who want something and say so plainly.
_Blessings he grants:_
- Fire mana that burns hotter and more controlled than ambient flame — precise enough to be surgical or broad enough to be devastating
- Resistance to heat and fire damage
- The ability to sense heat sources and emotional intensity in nearby creatures — Solrath's fire reads passion as well as temperature
- At deeper bonds: the ability to call flame from nothing rather than needing an existing source, and to briefly transform strikes or touch into fire

## Nerathi — Guardian of Water (neh-RAH-thee)

_Appearance:_ A fluid, shifting form that never fully settles — sometimes a woman made of still deep water, sometimes a current, sometimes barely visible at all. Her eyes are the only constant: dark and depthless.
_Personality:_ Patient to a degree that humans often mistake for coldness. Nerathi observes before she speaks, speaks carefully when she does, and rarely repeats herself. She is not unkind but she is not warm — she is deep, and depth is not always comfortable. She holds a long memory and a long view. Of the four Guardians she is the hardest to form a bond with, not because she refuses but because she waits to see if the person is serious.
_What she values:_ Patience, adaptability, and genuine emotional honesty. She distrusts people who perform more than they feel.
_Blessings she grants:_
- Water mana with exceptional versatility — it can heal, erode, flow around obstacles, or strike with the force of a current depending on how it is shaped
- The ability to breathe and move freely underwater
- Heightened intuition about people's true emotional states — Nerathi's water reads depth
- At deeper bonds: the ability to pull moisture from air or ground without a water source present, and to use water as a scrying medium to observe distant places she has touched before

## Vaelor — Guardian of Wind (VAY-lor)

_Appearance:_ Rarely fully visible — most often a presence in moving air, a voice from no direction in particular, or a briefly glimpsed silhouette moving fast through the sky. When he fully manifests he appears as a lean, sharp-featured figure with hair and clothes in constant motion regardless of whether there is wind.
_Personality:_ Restless, curious, and easily bored by anything that sits still too long. The most talkative of the four Guardians and the most unpredictable — he might answer a question with a question, disappear mid-conversation, or show up uninvited to offer an opinion nobody asked for. He is not malicious but he is capricious. He likes people who surprise him and loses interest in people who don't.
_What he values:_ Curiosity, adaptability, and a willingness to change direction. No respect for rigidity and a deep instinctive dislike of anything that tries to contain things unnecessarily.
_Blessings he grants:_
- Wind mana with emphasis on speed and precision — cutting, launching, redirecting, and moving through space faster than should be possible
- Enhanced agility and reaction speed
- The ability to muffle sound around oneself or project it across distances
- At deeper bonds: the ability to briefly ride wind currents over short distances as if flying, and to sense anything carried on the wind — sound, scent, the movement of distant creatures

## Gorrath — Guardian of Earth (GOR-rath)

_Appearance:_ Massive and still. A figure of stone and packed soil, slow-moving in the way that mountains are slow-moving — not incapable of speed, simply uninterested in it. Moss grows on his shoulders. His voice resonates in the chest more than the ears.
_Personality:_ The quietest and most deliberate of the four. Gorrath does not rush, does not raise his voice, and does not change his mind easily — but when he does it is because he has thought about it fully and means it. The most straightforwardly reliable of the Guardians. He has a deep, slow affection for things that endure — old trees, old stone, old bonds. His humor surfaces rarely and lands like a boulder.
_What he values:_ Steadfastness, honesty, and endurance. No interest in cleverness for its own sake. Responds to people who are where they say they will be and do what they say they will do.
_Blessings he grants:_
- Earth mana with emphasis on defense, weight, and permanence — raising barriers, anchoring ground, striking with immovable force
- Significant physical resilience — harder to move, harder to wound
- The ability to sense through ground contact — feeling vibrations, the movement of creatures, the structure of stone and soil nearby
- At deeper bonds: the ability to reshape earth and stone directly without a spell framework, and to root oneself in place in a way that makes forced movement nearly impossible

## Spirits in General

- Below the Major Guardians are countless lesser spirits — small presences tied to specific rivers, groves, mountains, weather patterns, or animals
- These are the spirits most human mana-drawers are actually interfacing with, often without knowing it
- A practitioner who cultivates a deliberate relationship with spirits — rather than simply drawing ambient mana — can access stronger and more stable flows, and may eventually come to the attention of a Major Guardian
