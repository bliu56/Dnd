## Original Plotline
---

### Past

Arthur, former Hero, defeated the Demon King and then found egg. Egg is to be the next Demon King. The Last Demon King requested that the Hero taken them in and raise them like a normal human and to live a normal life.

Some time later, Arthur and Kid now lives in the Twilight Forest between the Stonewood and the Lowfield.

The Pope had a revelation. He claims that the seed of the Demon King lives and decreed that it must be eliminated else danger greater than any they face will ravage the world.
There was a holy inquisition sent and they located the area it could be. The Church’s strongest went to lead it.

Eventually, they found the former Hero and Kid together. After a long fight, they bested the Hero and while the Hero used the last of his energy to teleport the Kid to safety. Arthur died and the Kid through his grief awaken his powers which resulted in the Forest turning into another color.

### Present

The Demon King has risen once more and has waged war agaisnt the world. Under new leadership, the Demons grew stronger and more united than before.

Michael, Luna, and John are on a journey to find the next Hero using an ancient Hero’s relic that is sealed inside a box that only a Hero can open. When someone with the potential to be a Hero tries to open the box, the box will start to glow with holy energy. They won’t be able to open the box but the church believes that it means that they just need training. At that point they get taken in to train at the Church as a hero candidate. While journeying from Stonewood to Lowfield, they encounter traces of attacks and eventually run into a Mimic Archdemon. John in a moment of crisis opens and was able to get them out of the situation.

## Story Line

### Act 1 — The Road to Lowfield (Present)

**Overview**
The players begin outside Stonewood's gates, freshly assigned as E-rank licensed escorts. Their job is simple on paper: bring Michael, Luna, and John safely from Stonewood to Lowfield, and then onward to Caldenveil _(KAL-den-vale)_. What starts as a routine escort becomes their first real encounter with the world — its warmth, its danger, and the weight of what the Twilight Forest used to be.

### Beat 1 — Arrival at the Gate

_Location: Stonewood South Gate_
The players spawn just outside Stonewood and make their way to the city gate where their escort assignment begins. They each carry an E-rank Guide License — the lowest tier, freshly issued, clearly magical in origin. At the gate they find Michael, Luna, and John already waiting.
**How to run it:**
- Give players a moment to introduce themselves to each other and to the group they're escorting
- Michael is warm and welcoming immediately — he thanks them sincerely and means it
- Luna sizes them up with obvious curiosity, probably makes a comment about their rank
- John says very little, gives each player a once-over, and goes back to watching the road
- Let this breathe — this is the first chance for players to get a read on all three and for NPC attachment to begin seeding naturally
- Captain Aldric may appear briefly at the gate to see Michael off — a small moment that establishes the Church's presence in the city and Aldric's relationship with duty
**Achievements available:**
- _First Impression_ — Make a strong introduction that gets a visible reaction from one of the three (Luna laughing, John actually responding, Michael being genuinely moved)
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player does something memorable during introductions — an unexpected greeting, immediately trying to size up John, making Michael laugh
- A player asks one of the three something personal and actually listens to the answer
- The group organically establishes a dynamic among themselves before even leaving the gate

### Beat 2 — Emmet Ashford

_Location: Stonewood South Gate, just before departure_
Just as the group is about to set off, a young man pushes through the small crowd near the gate and calls out to them. This is **Emmet Ashford** _(EM-et ASH-ford)_, mid-twenties, a textile merchant's son from Stonewood. He is visibly nervous, clutching his coat, and has clearly rehearsed what he is about to say.
**Who he is:**
- Works at his family's textile stall in Stonewood's market district
- Cheerful, earnest, a little bumbling — but genuinely kind
- Met a girl named **Sera Voss** _(SEH-rah VOSS)_ at Lowfield's pasture market months ago. She was on a supply run from Caldenveil; he was visiting Renwick, an old family contact. They spent an afternoon talking. He hasn't stopped thinking about her since.
- Has been too nervous to make the journey alone — the Twilight Forest makes the road dangerous and he has no combat ability whatsoever
**His request:**
Emmet asks — politely, then a little desperately — if he can join the group as far as Caldenveil. He offers to pay what he can. If players ask why he can't just wait for another escort, he admits there's a second reason.
He wants to stop in the Twilight Forest — not deep, just inside the treeline. His father used to tell a story: troubled about how to court Emmet's mother, he encountered six kind strangers who helped him gather rare flowers from the forest. He brought them to her and she said yes. The flowers were **Duskbloom** — deep violet petals that glow faintly at night, found only in the Twilight Forest. Emmet has always loved that story. He wants to bring Sera a bundle. He knows the forest is dangerous now. He knows it's a lot to ask. He asks anyway.
**How to run it:**
- Emmet's nervousness should be endearing — he's not a compelling speaker, he just clearly means every word
- Michael will almost certainly advocate for taking him along
- Luna will have opinions, loudly
- John will probably say it's their call and look away
- Players decide — but the Duskbloom errand seeds the forest detour naturally
- If players agree, Emmet is overwhelmed with relief and thanks them too many times
**Achievements available:**
- _Good Samaritans_ — Agree to take Emmet along without requiring payment
- _Oppertunist_ — Successfully negotiate payment or a favor from Emmet before agreeing
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player genuinely engages with Emmet's story rather than just accepting or rejecting the request
- A player asks Emmet to describe Sera and he gets flustered — reward whoever pushed that button
- A player takes Emmet's side against skeptical party members in a way that feels warm rather than transactional
- Someone makes a joke at Emmet's expense that lands well at the table — reward the read

### Beat 3 — The Road Through the Twilight Forest

_Location: The Twilight Forest road_
The group sets out. The transition from open land to forest is gradual, but once they're inside the shift in atmosphere is immediate. The colors are wrong. The light is wrong. Things move in the treeline.
**How to run it:**
- Describe the forest slowly — let the wrongness land before anything actually happens
- Michael walks calmly, seemingly unbothered, though he keeps his staff close
- Luna stays alert but covers it with chatter — she talks more when she's uneasy
- John goes quiet in a different way than usual — watchful, hand near his weapon
- Emmet stays very close to whoever seems most capable and tries not to look at the treeline
**The Duskbloom detour:**
- At some point Emmet spots what looks like Duskbloom just inside the treeline — maybe thirty feet off the path
- Getting them means leaving the road briefly
- The forest is not immediately hostile but it is watching — whatever lives here knows they're here
- This is a skill and roleplay challenge as much as a combat one: how do players protect Emmet, manage the group, and get back safely?
- If they succeed, Emmet carefully wraps the flowers in cloth from his coat lining. He doesn't say much. He just looks at them for a moment.
**Optional encounter — Named Beast:**
- One of the named beasts of the Twilight Forest can appear here as an optional combat encounter
- It should be challenging but not a guaranteed fight — clever players might drive it off or avoid it entirely
- Defeating it is an achievement. Running from it intelligently is also valid and patron-entertaining.
**Achievements available:**
- _Into the Dark_ — Leave the road to retrieve the Duskbloom
- _Beast Slayer_ — Defeat the named beast of the Twilight Forest
- _Tactical Retreat_ — Successfully avoid or escape the named beast without casualties
- _Florist_ — Retrieve a perfect bundle of Duskbloom with no damage to the flowers
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player stays close to Emmet unprompted and keeps him calm during the forest stretch
- A player makes a genuinely funny or daring call about leaving the road — reward the commitment either way
- John quietly steps up during the beast encounter without being asked — if a player noticed and acknowledges it in character, reward that
- A player does something clever to avoid or handle the named beast rather than just swinging at it
**Coming next in Act 1:**
- Arrival in Lowfield — meeting Edna, Benno, and Renwick for the first time
- Emmet's growing attachment to the party
- The onward journey to Caldenveil
- Emmet and Sera

### Event 1 — The Fog and the Forest

_Type: Atmosphere / Navigation_
Not long after the group enters the Twilight Forest, the violet fog rolls in. It doesn't arrive like weather — it arrives like a decision, thickening between the trees until visibility drops to thirty feet in every direction. The forest is still visible through it: glimmering purples and deep violets, the strange bioluminescent quality of the corrupted bark and undergrowth catching the fog's light and throwing it back in shifting patterns. If not for what lurks here, it would be genuinely beautiful. Several players may find themselves saying so despite themselves.
The road is still underfoot but harder to trust. Sounds are muffled and directionless. Something moves in the treeline — or multiple somethings — but nothing approaches.
**How to run it:**
- Open with a slow, vivid description of the fog and the forest's appearance — let the beauty land before the unease does
- Ask players how they're reacting and moving: bunched together, spread out, weapons drawn or not
- Michael walks without visible anxiety, staff in hand, eyes forward — he has traveled dangerous roads before
- Luna talks a little too much and a little too fast, filling the silence
- John stops talking entirely, moves to the rear of the group, and watches behind them without being asked
- Emmet is trying very hard not to be a burden and is failing slightly — he keeps almost tripping over his own feet from looking into the trees
**Navigation challenge:**
- Run a light perception or survival check for whoever is leading
- On a success: the group moves through cleanly, no issue
- On a failure: the group drifts slightly off the road without realizing it — not far, but far enough that the fog feels different around them, closer, and getting back takes a moment of scrambling
- This is not a dangerous failure, just an atmospheric one — it establishes that the forest can disorient even when nothing is attacking
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player comments on the forest's beauty despite the danger — genuine, not sarcastic
- A player notices John has moved to the rear and says nothing, just adjusts their own position accordingly
- Someone checks on Emmet without being prompted

### Event 2 — The Mutated Beast

_Type: Combat_
Something in the Twilight Forest finds the group. Pick one of the three beasts below based on what fits the session — or roll randomly. Each was once a common forest animal. Twenty years inside the Twilight Forest has done the rest.
**The Beasts:**
**Veilstag** _(formerly a stag)_
A stag the size of a draft horse, its antlers fused into a single twisted crown of black bone that pulses faintly violet at the tips. Its coat has gone translucent in patches, revealing the mana running through it like veins of light beneath the skin. It moves without sound — not quietly, but silently, as if the sound has simply been removed from its footsteps. It does not charge immediately. It watches first.
_Behavior:_ Territorial. It wants the group out of its range, not necessarily dead. It will charge if approached or if the group lingers too long. Can be driven off without being killed if players make enough noise, light, or force it to take significant damage.
- **AC:** 15 | **HP:** 95 | **Speed:** 50 ft.
- **CR:** 5
- _**Silence Step.**_ The Veilstag makes no sound when it moves. It cannot be heard approaching and does not trigger sound-based reactions.
- _**Gore.** +7 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 2d8+5 piercing. On a hit, the target is pushed 10 ft. and must make a DC 14 Str save or be knocked prone.
- _**Mana Pulse (Recharge 5–6).**_ The antlers release a burst of corrupted mana in a 20 ft. cone. Each creature in the area makes a DC 14 Con save, taking 3d10 necrotic damage on a fail or half on a success.
- _**Territorial Charge.**_ If the Veilstag moves at least 20 ft. in a straight line before hitting, the Gore attack deals an additional 2d8 damage.
**Ashcrawler** _(formerly a bear)_
A bear, or what was one. Its body has bloated and hardened, the fur replaced in places by a thick chitinous plating the color of charcoal. Its eyes are gone — replaced by six small glowing points of violet light arranged across its face. It navigates entirely by sensing mana, which means it is blind to creatures who aren't using magic and acutely aware of those who are. It moves on all fours but can rear up to a terrifying height.
_Behavior:_ Aggressive and direct once it detects the group. It prioritizes spellcasters or anyone actively using magic above others. Cannot be easily driven off — it commits once it engages.
- **AC:** 16 (natural armor) | **HP:** 120 | **Speed:** 40 ft.
- **CR:** 6
- _**Mana Sense.**_ The Ashcrawler automatically detects any creature using magic within 60 ft. It has advantage on attacks against creatures that have cast a spell this encounter.
- _**Blind to the Mundane.**_ Creatures that have not used magic this encounter are effectively invisible to the Ashcrawler — it must guess their location. Attacks against such creatures have disadvantage.
- _**Slam.** +8 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 2d10+5 bludgeoning. On a hit, the target makes a DC 15 Con save or is stunned until the end of their next turn.
- _**Plated Charge.**_ Once per encounter: the Ashcrawler charges up to 40 ft. in a line. Each creature in its path makes a DC 15 Dex save, taking 4d8 bludgeoning damage on a fail or half on a success.
- _**Chitin Armor.**_ The first time the Ashcrawler would take more than 15 damage from a single hit, reduce that damage by 10.
**Duskwing** _(formerly a large owl)_
A massive owl, wingspan stretching twelve feet, its feathers now the deep black-violet of the forest at its worst. The feathers at the wingtips have hardened into something resembling blades. It flies without disturbing the air — no downwash, no sound. Its call, when it makes one, is not a screech but a low resonant tone that rattles in the chest. It hunts from above and prefers to separate its prey from the group before striking.
_Behavior:_ Methodical and patient. It circles above the fog line and waits for a target to fall behind or be isolated. It will break off if it takes significant damage, retreat into the fog, and may return once — players should feel like it's watching even after it withdraws.
- **AC:** 14 | **HP:** 78 | **Speed:** 10 ft. / fly 60 ft.
- **CR:** 4
- _**Silent Flight.**_ The Duskwing makes no sound while flying. It cannot be heard and does not trigger opportunity attacks caused by sound detection.
- _**Isolation Strike.**_ If the Duskwing attacks a creature that has no ally within 10 ft., the attack deals an additional 2d6 damage and the target must make a DC 13 Wis save or be frightened until the end of their next turn.
- _**Talon Rake.** +6 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 2d6+4 slashing. On a hit, the target's movement speed is reduced by 10 ft. until the end of their next turn (blade-feather cuts).
- _**Resonance Call (1/Day).**_ The Duskwing emits its deep tone. Each creature within 30 ft. makes a DC 13 Con save or is incapacitated until the end of their next turn as the sound disrupts their focus.
- _**Fade and Return.**_ If the Duskwing takes 20 or more damage in a single turn, it retreats into the fog. It may return at the start of the next round on a roll of 4–6 (d6), arriving from a different direction.
**How to run the encounter:**
- Give the party a moment of warning — a sound, a shadow, a feeling — before the beast fully reveals itself
- Michael will engage if necessary but defers to the players — this is their job
- Luna will heal and support, staying behind cover
- John will fight — efficiently, without flourish, and noticeably well for someone of his stated rank
- Emmet will find the nearest large tree and stay behind it. He will not be useful. He will be apologetic about this afterward.
- After the fight, if John performed well, Michael will quietly note it to whoever is nearest — "he always does that"
**How performance affects camp:**
- _Strong performance_ (the party handled it cleanly, protected the escort targets, made smart decisions): The training request happens at camp
- _Acceptable performance_ (they won but it was messy): Michael considers it — the request may happen but with less certainty, or only if a specific player stood out
- _Poor performance_ (escort targets were endangered, players made reckless decisions): No training request. Michael and Luna are quieter at camp. John says nothing.
**Achievements available:**
- _Beast Slayer_ — Defeat the mutated beast
- _Not a Scratch_ — Complete the encounter with no escort target taking damage
- _Identify the Hunt_ — Correctly identify the creature's behavior pattern and exploit it
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player uses a creative or unexpected solution rather than straight damage
- A player specifically positions themselves to protect Emmet without being asked
- A player notices John fighting and comments on it in character
- Someone makes a decision that's genuinely funny or genuinely daring mid-combat

### Event 3 — Camp in the Twilight Forest

_Type: Rest / Roleplay_
The group stops to make camp just off the road — not far, just enough to get clear of the immediate sightlines. The fog has thinned slightly but not gone. The forest glimmers around them in the dark, violet light pulsing faintly from the bark and undergrowth. It is, objectively, a beautiful place to sleep in. Nobody is fully comfortable.
A fire is made. Watches are assigned. Food is shared — Emmet has brought more than expected and insists on contributing, which is the most useful he has been all day.
**NPC behavior at camp:**
- **Michael** sits close to the fire, relaxed, seemingly at ease. He is the kind of person who has learned to rest when rest is available. He will talk to anyone who approaches him, and his questions tend to be genuine rather than polite.
- **Luna** stays busy — checks equipment, tends to any injuries, then eventually settles down and becomes more talkative the longer the night goes on. She is chattier in the dark than she is on the road.
- **John** eats, says little, and watches the treeline. He will answer direct questions with direct answers and nothing more. He is not unfriendly — he just doesn't volunteer.
- **Emmet** is quietly processing the day. He checks on the Duskbloom several times to make sure they survived the journey intact. He will talk about Sera if anyone asks, at length, with the slightly dazed expression of someone who still can't quite believe the afternoon in Lowfield happened.
**Conversation prompts — things NPCs may ask players:**
- _Michael to anyone:_ "What brought you to this kind of work? Guide licensing isn't the most obvious path."
- _Michael to anyone:_ "Do you believe the Hero will be found? Genuinely — not the Church line. What do you think?"
- _Luna to anyone she's warmed to:_ "Do you ever get scared? On a job like this, I mean. Or does it stop bothering you eventually?"
- _Luna to anyone:_ "Where are you going after Caldenveil? Or is this just — one job at a time?"
- _John if directly asked about himself:_ "I'm here to do the work. That's all." — but if pushed genuinely: "I had something I needed to be closer to. The Church put me in the right direction."
- _Emmet to anyone who sits near him:_ "Can I ask you something? When you do something terrifying — does it ever start to feel normal? Or does it always feel like the first time?"
**The training request (conditional — strong/acceptable performance only):**
After camp has settled and the fire has burned lower, Michael approaches whichever player performed best in the beast encounter — or the group as a whole if the performance was collectively strong. He is direct about it, no preamble:
_"John trains alone. He always has. I've been trying to find the right moment to suggest he work with someone who can push back. Would any of you be willing to spar with him — properly — tomorrow, or along the road?"_
If players agree, John doesn't object. He doesn't look pleased either. He just nods once and goes back to watching the treeline.
If players ask why John doesn't train with Michael or Luna: Michael smiles quietly. _"He's already past what I can offer him in that regard. Luna would heal him before he learned anything. He needs someone who'll hit him back."_
**John's late-night training:**
Regardless of how camp goes, sometime in the deep of the night — during a watch change or a quiet moment — John slips away from camp into the forest. He doesn't go far. The sounds of controlled movement, the muffled impact of strikes against a tree, the quiet rhythm of someone who has done this every night for years, drift back faintly.
- A player on watch has the highest chance of noticing — DC 12 Perception
- A player who is awake for any reason can also roll
- If noticed: the player can observe quietly, follow him, or wake someone. John will not stop if approached — he'll acknowledge the player with a look and keep going. If asked why: _"I sleep better after."_
- If nobody notices: describe the faint sounds to the table in the morning briefing — "at some point in the night, you may have heard something" — and let them piece it together
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player has a genuine, unscripted conversation with an NPC that goes somewhere unexpected
- A player shares something real about their character's motivations unprompted
- A player follows John into the forest and just — trains with him, without making it a scene
- A player comforts Emmet about the day in a way that feels earned
- Someone asks Michael about Arthur — he'll deflect warmly, but reward the instinct

### Event 4 — Something Off the Road

_Type: Exploration / Atmosphere (Chance — triggers only if players leave the road or investigate)_
This event does not happen automatically. It requires the players to make a choice — to leave the road or follow something into the trees. Pick one of the triggers below based on what fits the session, or let player curiosity do the work naturally.
**Possible triggers:**
- _The glint:_ Emmet notices something catching the violet light between the trees — too regular to be bark, too still to be a creature. He mentions it quietly, not sure if it's worth saying anything.
- _The sound:_ One player hears something faint and rhythmic deeper in the forest. Not threatening — almost musical, like wind moving through something hollow. It doesn't repeat if they stop to listen. It starts again when they walk.
- _The animal:_ A small creature — something that was once a fox, now with an extra pair of legs and fur the color of twilight — darts off the road ahead of them and stops twenty feet into the trees. It looks back. Then moves again, slowly, like it is waiting.
- _The feeling:_ No trigger — a player simply decides to leave the road and investigate the forest. The others may follow or not.
**If they follow:**
The fog thickens almost immediately — not gradually, but in distinct steps, as if responding to their movement. The trees grow older and more widely spaced the further they go. The undergrowth is wrong in a way that's hard to articulate: things growing that have no business growing here, in colors that don't exist in normal forests.
Then the trees open into a clearing.
At the far edge of it, half-swallowed by the Twilight Forest's creeping vegetation but unmistakably intact, is a house. Wooden, hand-built, carefully made. A covered porch. A cleared practice area in front. The trees around it are dark and strange but the clearing itself is — still. Quiet in a way the rest of the forest is not. The fog does not enter the clearing.
The party can see it clearly from the tree line. They cannot get closer.
**The fog barrier:**
As players move toward the clearing, the fog thickens along the path ahead — not dramatically, not with sound or force, but with a kind of absolute certainty. Visibility drops to zero in the direction of the house. Players who push into it feel — not threatened, not in pain — but deeply, instinctively unwelcome. Like walking into a room that belongs to someone and knowing it the moment you cross the threshold. Most players will stop on their own. If a player pushes through regardless, they emerge on the other side of the fog patch still at the treeline — as if the fog has simply redirected them without their noticing.
**What they can see from the treeline:**
- The house is intact and maintained — not a ruin
- The door is closed but there is no lock visible
- There are no lights inside
- The practice area in front shows signs of recent use — disturbed earth, the impression of footwork patterns in the ground
- The vegetation around the clearing stops at a clean, unnatural line — as if something has told it not to cross
Nobody lives there. Or — nobody is there right now.
**DM note:** Do not name the house. Do not explain it. Let players speculate. If Michael sees it, he goes very still and says nothing. If pressed, he says quietly: _"We should keep moving."_ He doesn't look back.
**Achievements available:**
- _Off the Beaten Path_ — Leave the road and discover the clearing

### The Feeling That Follows

_Triggered after the clearing, lasts until Lowfield_
Whether or not the players found the cabin, something changes in the forest after Event 4. The party begins to notice — gradually, then unmistakably — that something is behind them.
It is not subtle. Branches shift in their wake in a pattern that doesn't match the wind. The fog moves around something that isn't visible. Perception checks confirm it: something large, something aware, something that is keeping exact pace with the group without closing the distance.
It does not attack. It does not make a sound. But it is there, and it knows they know, and it doesn't care.
**How to run it:**
- Describe it in increments — the first sign is easy to dismiss, the second less so, the third is undeniable
- Let players decide how to respond: ignore it, try to confront it, move faster, set a trap
- If they try to confront it: the fog shifts, something moves — large, definitely larger than anything they fought earlier — and then it is simply not where it was. It is behind them again.
- If they set a trap: the trap triggers on nothing. Whatever it is, it was not where they thought it was.
- John's jaw tightens. He does not draw his weapon. He keeps walking.
- Michael watches the treeline for a long moment, then faces forward again. His expression is unreadable.
**When they reach Lowfield:**
The moment the first player steps past the tree line into the open ground approaching Lowfield, the presence stops. Not gradually — immediately. The fog thins. The forest behind them is still. Whatever was following them is gone, and has been gone since the tree line, as if it simply ceased at the border.
Nobody says anything about it. Nobody needs to.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player tries something genuinely creative to identify or confront the presence
- A player notices John's reaction and comments on it in character
- A player is the last one to step out of the forest and pauses at the tree line to look back — reward that instinct

### Lowfield — Rest Stop

_Type: Rest / Character / Atmosphere_
Lowfield hits differently after the Twilight Forest. The lane is unpaved and quiet, the houses are small, chickens wander freely, and somewhere nearby someone is baking bread. It is aggressively, almost stubbornly normal. After what the party just walked through, normal is disorienting in the best possible way.
Michael exhales when they arrive — genuinely, visibly. Luna immediately starts talking at full volume again, like someone who has been holding it in. John looks at the village for a long moment, something unreadable crossing his face, and then says nothing. Emmet starts smiling and doesn't stop.
The party has time. Let them use it however they want. The moments below can happen in any order, or not at all — follow where players go.

### Moment — Edna's Cafe

Edna knows they're coming before they arrive. Word travels fast in Lowfield and a group of six escorts plus an Archbishop is not something that goes unnoticed on the lane. By the time the party reaches the cafe, there is already food on the counter.
She feeds them first and asks questions second — that is simply how she operates. The food is good. Better than good. After two days in the Twilight Forest it is almost aggressively comforting.
Edna will talk to anyone who lets her. She is warm, sharp, and completely unintimidated by anyone at the table. If players ask about the village she answers easily — the farms, the families, the weather, who is feuding with whom over a fence line. She does not bring up the war. She does not bring up demons. If players bring it up themselves she pauses, then says simply: _"Nothing bad comes here. Never has, even now. We don't ask why. We just count ourselves lucky."_ Then she moves on.
On the wall behind the counter, among other small things, is a hand-drawn sketch in a simple frame. It shows a boy — maybe twelve — sitting on the bench outside the cafe, eating something. The drawing is old, the edges worn. The boy in it looks exactly like he could have sat down yesterday.
Edna does not point it out. She does not mention it unless asked. If a player notices and asks who it is, she looks at it for a moment with an expression that is warm and a little complicated: _"A boy who used to come through with his father. Years ago now."_ She does not say more unless pushed. If pushed further: _"He had a sweet tooth something terrible. I always made sure there was something ready."_ She does not say his name.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player notices the sketch on their own without being prompted
- A player asks Edna about the village's safety and genuinely listens to her non-answer
- A player just sits quietly and eats without doing anything — reward the rest

### Moment — The Millstone

Benno has rooms ready. He always has rooms ready — it is simply what he does. He doesn't make a fuss about the party's arrival, just checks them in efficiently and shows them where things are. The rooms are clean. The beds are real beds. After the forest floor this is remarkable.
If players linger in the common room, Benno will be there — not hovering, just present. He keeps busy. He is not a gossip and does not ask questions about where they've been or where they're going. But he pays attention. If a player looks worn down he will quietly set something warm in front of them without comment.
At some point during the stay, if any player is up late or wanders downstairs, they may notice: one of the three rooms upstairs has its door slightly ajar, and inside it is clearly not being used for storage or guests. The bed is made with particular care. There is nothing in the room except furniture — no personal effects, no decoration — but it is maintained like it matters. If a player asks Benno about it he pauses in what he's doing and says: _"That room's taken."_ He does not explain. He does not seem to think further explanation is required.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player notices the reserved room and follows up with Benno
- A player thanks Benno genuinely — not just in passing — and he actually looks up from what he's doing

### Moment — The Lane

The village lane is exactly what it looks like: a quiet unpaved road, gardens on either side, neighbors occasionally calling to each other across it. There is nothing suspicious here. There is nothing wrong. It is just a village that is fine, in a world where villages are not supposed to be fine anymore.
If players walk the lane they may notice, without being told to look: there are no abandoned houses. Every building is occupied, every garden is tended. In the broader world, villages this size have lost a third of their population to raids or evacuation. This one hasn't lost anyone. The community stockpile in the old barn at the edge of the pasture — visible through the open doors if players pass it — is quietly enormous for a village this size, neatly organized, and clearly added to regularly. Nobody seems to be in charge of it. It simply exists.
An older farmer — Renwick, if players encounter him — will answer questions about the village in the fewest possible words. He is not evasive, just economical. If players ask directly why Lowfield has been untouched by the war, he looks at them for a long moment and says: _"Don't know. Thought about it. Don't know."_ Then, after a pause: _"There was a man used to come through here. Him and his boy. Good man. Real quiet. Forest type."_ He does not continue unless asked. If asked: _"Haven't seen him in a long time. Boy neither."_ He picks up whatever he was doing. The conversation is over unless players reopen it.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player puts the stockpile, the intact houses, and Renwick's comment together and says something about it out loud
- A player asks Renwick a follow-up question about the man and his boy and actually sits down to hear the answer

### Moment — Emmet in Lowfield

Emmet is having the best day he has had in months. He knows this village — he has been here before, that one afternoon with Sera — and being back in it makes him happy in a slightly overwhelming way. He keeps stopping to look at things. The bench outside Edna's cafe. The spot at the pasture market where Sera's cart was parked. The lane itself.
If any player walks with him, he will talk. Not about Sera specifically — he is trying to play it cool and failing — but about the afternoon they met. The way she explained the pricing of preserved goods to him like it was fascinating rather than commercial. The fact that she laughed at something he said and he still isn't sure if it was at him or with him but he chooses to believe with him. The way she looked when she was packing up her cart to leave.
He stops at one point and looks at the pasture market and says, half to himself: _"I've never done anything brave before. In my whole life. Yesterday was the first time."_ He clearly means the forest, the flowers, the asking. He does not seem to realize he has said this out loud until a beat later, when he looks slightly embarrassed. _"Anyway."_
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player walks the lane with Emmet without being asked to
- A player responds to Emmet's accidental admission in a way that is kind without being condescending

### Act 1 Finale — The Demon General Mimic

_Type: Ambush / Forced Retreat — End of Act 1_
After leaving Lowfield the road changes. The Twilight Forest is behind them. The unnamed forest between here and Caldenveil is ordinary — quiet, green, light behaving as light should. The mood lifts. The worst of the journey is over. Caldenveil is ahead. Let this breathe for a moment. The party needs to feel safe before it stops being safe.

### Version A — Emmet is with the party

The road is easy and the conversation is good. Emmet has been walking with more confidence than he has shown all trip — there's an energy to him that wasn't there in the Twilight Forest, something lighter. He keeps touching the inside of his coat where the Duskbloom are wrapped.
Then he sees it. Just off the path, close enough to reach in under a minute — one final Duskbloom, growing alone at the base of a tree. The last one he needs to complete the bundle.
He looks at the party. He looks at the flower. He looks at the party again.
_"It's right there. I'll just — one second. I'll be right back."_
He doesn't wait for permission. He crosses the short distance with the slightly undignified speed of someone trying to look casual while doing something they're excited about. He crouches. Gets the flower free without damaging it. Stands.
He turns around to face the party. He holds the flower up. He has the complete bundle in his other hand. He is grinning — genuinely, fully, the expression of someone who cannot believe their own luck and is not trying to hide it. He opens his mouth to say something —
A pitch black blade erupts from his chest.
It came from directly behind him. From a shadow that was not there a moment ago. The Demon General Mimic has been there the entire time — patient, still, waiting for exactly this: a turned back, a moment of joy, a split second of absolute inattention.
Emmet looks down at the blade. He is still holding the flowers. He does not drop them.
The Mimic withdraws the blade and steps back. Emmet falls.
**Saving Emmet:**
He is alive but will not be for long without help. A player must reach him, stabilize him, and get him moving — at minimum one action to stabilize and someone to support his weight. Luna can assist if players are moving rather than fighting.
- Stabilized and carried within 3 rounds: Emmet survives, gravely wounded, unconscious — still holding the flowers when they pry them from his hand
- Not reached in time: Emmet dies in the road with the complete bundle in his hands

### Version B — Emmet is not with the party

The road is quiet. Ordinary forest on both sides. Then a girl emerges from the trees ahead — young, maybe fifteen, clearly injured, clutching her arm and moving unevenly. She looks at the party like someone who has been running for a very long time.
She points — not forward, but behind the party. Back the way they came.
_"There are monsters. Back there. In the trees. They're coming."_
Then she collapses.
**The inconsistency:**
The party came from that direction. They saw nothing. Players who stop to think — why is she pointing behind them, why did they not encounter anything from that direction, why did she emerge from the opposite side of the road — can make a DC 13 Insight or Perception check to register that something is wrong.
If nobody flags it, Luna is already moving. She is crouching beside the girl, hands glowing with healing light, before anyone has finished processing the scene. It is exactly what Luna does. It is not a mistake — it is who she is.
As the light reaches the girl, her hand shifts. The fingers elongate, darken, fuse — and a pitch black blade drives up into Luna's side.
Luna makes no sound. She just — stops. And then lists sideways.
**Luna's condition:**
Incapacitated. Breathing, but cannot cast, cannot move under her own power, will not stabilize without immediate healing from another source. She needs to be carried. Every round she goes without healing, her condition worsens.
The Mimic drops the disguise. What stands up is vast and wrong and has been patient for a long time

### Fight or Flight

_The moment after Vael'shar reveals itself and Michael steps forward_
The party has three options: rescue the wounded, stay and fight, or run. Michael's order is to run. What the party does is up to them — but every path eventually leads to the same place: cornered, outmatched, and John holding a box that has never opened for anyone.

### Option 1 — Rescue

The party's priority is getting to Emmet or Luna before worrying about anything else. This is largely player-driven — how they move, who covers who, whether they succeed in time. Wing this based on the table.
The key tension: every round spent on rescue is a round not running. Vael'shar is occupied with Michael, but Michael will not hold indefinitely. The rescue window is real but it is closing.
Once the wounded are stabilized and moving, the party is still in the same situation — they need to run, and Vael'shar will eventually be behind them.

### Option 2 — Stay and Fight

They can try. Vael'shar will let them try for exactly long enough to make the point.
The first player to attack gets a response — one strike, precise and contemptuous, that deals enough damage to make the gap in capability undeniable. Vael'shar does not follow up. It returns its attention to Michael as if the player has already been accounted for.
If the party persists: Michael will not say it again. He said run. Whether they listened is on them. Eventually, when Michael goes down or the damage becomes untenable, the party will run anyway — just worse off than if they had gone immediately.
Wing the specifics. The point is not to kill players, it is to make the correct decision obvious in hindsight.

### Option 3 — Run

The party can run in two directions: toward Caldenveil, or back toward Lowfield. Both paths lead to the same outcome — Michael is killed — but they play out differently.
**Running toward Caldenveil:**
The party moves fast. The sounds of the fight behind them are enormous and then, at a point they can't precisely identify, stop. Not a conclusion. Just silence.
Vael'shar is not immediately behind them — but it will be. It finishes what it came for first. The party has a window: keep running, or hide.
- _Keep running:_ They may reach Caldenveil's gates before Vael'shar catches up. The gates, the guards, the city — these change the calculation for Vael'shar. It is not gone, but it chooses not to follow into a populated, defensible location. For now.
- _Hide:_ DC 18 Stealth as a group. On a success, Vael'shar passes by — they can hear it moving, feel the wrongness of its presence in the air, and then it is gone. On a failure, it finds them.
**Running toward Lowfield:**
Vael'shar does not follow toward Lowfield. The party does not know why. It kills Michael, and then it simply does not pursue in that direction. The forest road back to the village is clear.
_DM Note: Vael'shar knows what Lowfield is. It knows who protects it. It will not go there._
In either direction, if Vael'shar catches up before the party reaches safety, it is not immediately lethal — it wants the Hero's Box, which it now suspects one of them may be carrying or may be connected to. It will hurt them. It will demand it. And then John opens the box.

### The Box Opens

This triggers when a player tells John to try the box — in a moment of desperation, as a last idea, because there is nothing else left to try.
John has been told before. Michael told him, more than once, in the way Michael tells people things — gently, with patience, without pressure. John always said no. He didn't see himself as anything the box would respond to.
He picks it up now because someone asked and because there is nothing else.
The box does not glow. It does not make a sound. It simply — opens. Like it was never locked. Like it has been waiting for exactly this.
Inside is nothing that looks like a weapon. A small mark — a seal, a sigil, something that has no immediate name — lifts from the interior of the box as if it were always meant to go somewhere. It finds John's hand. It burns in, slow and deliberate, like something being written rather than branded. John makes no sound. His expression is unreadable.
Then the mark flares.
The light that comes from it is not like Luna's healing light or Michael's divine condemnation. It is quieter than that, and somehow worse — a focused, personal radiance that has no interest in illuminating anything except its target. It hits Vael'shar like a weight. Not an explosion. Not a beam. Just — pressure, and heat, and the specific quality of something that recognizes what Vael'shar is and has decided it is not welcome here.
Vael'shar is wounded. Not critically. Not enough to change what it is. But it steps back — and for a creature that has never needed to step back from anything the party has seen, the sight of it doing so lands hard.
It looks at John for a long moment.
Then it leaves. No words. No threat. It simply turns and is gone, folding back into shadow and road and the ordinary-looking forest, and the silence it leaves behind is the most unsettling thing about the whole encounter. A creature like that does not retreat to regroup. It retreats because it has learned something. And it will act on what it learned.
John stares at the mark on his hand for a long moment. The box is empty now — whatever was inside it is part of him. He closes his hand slowly.
Nobody says anything. There is nothing to say yet.
**What the mark is:**
The mark is John's Hero Candidate seal — the Goddess's acknowledgment that this person has the potential to become a Hero. It is not a power grant. It is a recognition. The power that came from it was John's own, expressed through the seal for the first time, raw and uncontrolled and enough.

**Achievements available:**
- _Against the Odds_ — Arrive at Caldenveil with all living party members and escort targets intact
- _We Don't Leave People_ — Stay to fight despite everything, even briefly, before retreating
- _Fast Hands_ — Stabilize Emmet before he dies _(Version A only)_
- _Something Was Wrong_ — Flag the inconsistency before Luna acts _(Version B only)_
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player's immediate reaction to the Mimic reveal — fear, rage, a terrible joke, complete silence — is genuinely memorable
- A player says something to Michael before running — anything at all
- A player looks back while running
- Someone reaches Caldenveil and just sits down on the ground without saying a word

### Act 2 — Before the Fall

**Overview**
The party arrives in the Past. The world is unrecognizable — warm, whole, nothing like the one they survived. Caldenveil is peaceful. The Evergreen Forest is green. The people they met as worn-down survivors are here young and unhurt. The party knows exactly how it ends. Nobody else does.
The decree has just been issued. The inquisition is being assembled. They have been hired to clear beasts along the raid path — officially, to help apprehend a fugitive. They know who the fugitive is. They know what apprehend means. What they do with that knowledge is entirely up to them.

### Beat 1 — The Posting

_Location: Caldenveil, Past_
The party arrives in Caldenveil to find it mid-preparation. Not visibly — the city looks normal, peaceful, the kind of warm and unhurried that Stonewood used to be before the war. But if they know where to look, the signs are there: Church officials moving with purpose, closed-door meetings in the upper quarters, a subtle increase in armed escorts accompanying robed figures through the streets.
The posting finds them quickly — or they find it. A Church logistics officer named **Brennan Holt** is recruiting licensed guides and cleared escorts for what he describes as a sensitive Church security operation into the Evergreen Forest. The work is straightforward: clear the major beasts along a designated corridor so that Church personnel can move through safely. The pay is good. The paperwork is minimal. Questions about the operation's purpose are met with a pleasant, practiced non-answer.
_"We're bringing in a fugitive who's been living in the forest. The beasts are the logistical problem — that's where you come in. What happens after isn't your concern."_
He is not lying, exactly. He simply is not telling them who the fugitive is.
**Brennan Holt — NPC**
- Church logistics officer, mid-thirties, efficient and impersonal
- Genuinely believes the operation is just — the Pope issued the decree, Adonis is leading it, his job is to make the path clear
- Has no idea what Arthur is or was. To him this is paperwork.
- If players push for details: _"Former resident of the forest. The Church has business with him. That's all I'm authorized to share."_
- If players ask about the child: a brief pause. _"There may be a minor involved. The Church will handle that appropriately."_ He moves on quickly.
- Not a villain. Will not become one. He is a man doing a job he has not thought hard enough about.
**What the party knows:**
Everything. They know the fugitive is Arthur. They know the child is Tristan. They know Adonis leads the inquisition. They know Arthur dies. They are being hired to make that easier.
**What they can do:**
- **Take the job** — gives them access to the raid corridor, knowledge of the inquisition's timeline and route, and proximity to events they can try to shape
- **Sabotage from inside** — take the job and do it wrong: leave beasts alive in key locations, clear the wrong paths, feed bad information back to Brennan
- **Refuse** — they lose the access but they're free to act independently. Harder to get close to Arthur without the Church's cover.
- **Use the job to warn Arthur** — take the job, learn the timeline, and get to Arthur before the inquisition does
All of these are valid. The job is a tool. What they build with it is theirs.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player's reaction when Brennan says "former resident of the forest" — the moment they realize they know exactly who he means
- A player asks about the child and watches Brennan move past it
- The party's first conversation among themselves after Brennan leaves — what do they decide to do

### Beat 2 — The Forest Road

_Location: The road from Caldenveil toward Lowfield_
The road from Caldenveil toward Lowfield is well-traveled and in good repair — this is peacetime, and it shows. Merchants use it regularly. The verges are clear. Waystones mark every few miles with distances carved in legible hands. The first stretch out of Caldenveil is open farmland and low hills, and after that the road enters a stretch of ordinary woodland — tall oaks, dappled light, birdsong. Nothing unusual about it. It is simply a forest road in a world that is, right now, fine.
The party has been hired to clear the route. "Clear" in this context means beasts — the woodland has the usual population of territorial animals, and the Church wants its personnel to move through without incident. It is routine work. The forest is not dangerous so much as it is occasionally inconvenient.
There are three things that happen on this road. Let the journey breathe between them.

### Road Event 1 — The Boar

_Type: Combat — Fun & Manageable_
_Location: A wide bend in the road where an old oak has fallen across a drainage ditch, creating a natural blind_
They hear it before they see it — a heavy, irregular rustling in the undergrowth to the left, then the wet crack of something rooting through dead wood. A moment later a large boar shoulders out of the brush and stops in the middle of the road, blocking the path entirely.
It is not a monster. It is just a very large boar, doing what boars do: being enormous, being unimpressed, and currently deciding whether the group is a threat to the stretch of woodland it has decided is its territory. It has a fresh scrape along its left flank — something already annoyed it today — and its ears are flat.
This is the kind of animal that experienced travelers know to respect. It is not aggressive by nature, but it has committed to this road and it weighs as much as a draft horse.
**The Boar — Statblock:**
_Large Beast, Unaligned_
- **AC:** 11 (natural hide) | **HP:** 42 (5d10 + 15) | **Speed:** 40 ft. | **CR:** 2
- **STR** 17 (+3) | **DEX** 10 (+0) | **CON** 16 (+3) | **INT** 2 (−4) | **WIS** 7 (−2) | **CHA** 5 (−3)
- **Senses:** Passive Perception 8
**Traits**
- _**Charge.**_ If the boar moves at least 20 ft. straight toward a target and hits with a Tusk attack on the same turn, the target takes an extra 2d6 slashing damage and must succeed on a DC 13 Str save or be knocked prone.
- _**Relentless (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).**_ If the boar takes 10 damage or fewer that would reduce it to 0 HP, it is reduced to 1 HP instead.
**Actions**
- _**Tusk.** +5 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 2d6+3 slashing.
**How to run it:**
- The boar is not immediately aggressive — it postures first, snorting and tearing up the road dirt with one tusk. Players have a full round to decide their approach before it commits.
- It can be driven off. Loud noise, fire, or a couple of solid hits will convince it this road is not worth the trouble. Players who try to scare it away rather than kill it should get to feel clever.
- If it charges, it is fast and hits hard and goes straight for whoever is in front. Relentless means the first time someone thinks they've finished it, they haven't — it scrambles back up with what Brennan's posting memo probably called "typical woodland tenacity."
- John sidesteps its charge with a neatness that suggests he has dealt with boars before. He doesn't comment on this.
- Luna immediately wants to know if it's injured, pointing out the scrape. She is correct. This is not useful information in the moment.
**What happens after:**
The road is clear. The boar retreats into the brush either dead or having decided it has better things to do. Michael crouches to look at the tracks for a moment before standing up. _"Good work. That's what we're here for."_ He says it plainly, not as praise exactly — more as acknowledgment that the job is what it is and they did it well.
If the party drove it off rather than killing it, he nods once and says nothing further. That's approval.
**Achievements available:**
- _Cleared_ — Remove the boar from the road by any means
- _No Harm Done_ — Drive the boar off without killing it
- _Not a Scratch_ — Complete the encounter with no escort target taking damage
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player immediately moves to protect the most vulnerable member of the group without being asked
- Someone gets knocked prone by the charge and their reaction to it is genuinely funny or genuinely committed
- A player tries to scare it off and it works — reward the instinct
- Luna's injury observation comes up again later and turns out to be relevant

### Road Event 2 — The Ironway Company

_Type: Social / Betrayal — Slow Burn_
_Location: A waystation about two hours into the woodland — a stone outbuilding with a cleared flat area in front, maintained by Caldenveil for traveling merchants_
Late afternoon. The waystation is already occupied when the party arrives — six people, a fire going, gear stacked neatly. One of them spots the party from fifty feet away, stands up, and waves them over with the easy confidence of someone who has already decided the situation is fine.
This is **Davo Irne** _(DAY-voh IRN)_, self-appointed voice of the **Ironway Company** — a mid-sized escort crew that works the Caldenveil–Lowfield–Stonewood circuit. Davo is broad-shouldered, loud in a way that sounds friendly, and has the specific energy of a man who is always selling something even when he doesn't appear to be.
The full company: Davo, two fighters named **Holt** and **Brek**, an archer called **Nessa**, a quiet wiry man who handles logistics and hasn't offered a name, and a young woman named **Calla** who watches the party with more genuine curiosity than any of her crewmates.
**Who they are:**
- A legitimate escort company with two years on this route — they know the road well
- Not criminals by nature. Opportunistic by habit. Peacetime means the escort business is competitive and margins are thin.
- Have been asking around in Caldenveil about the Church's new beast-clearing contract. They didn't get it. The party did.
- Have decided to do something about that — not violently, just cleverly. The plan is to tail the party through the woodland, let them do the hard clearing work, and then present themselves to the Church on arrival as the crew that "assisted with the operation." Brennan Holt is new to the region and unlikely to know the difference.
- Have already decided this. They're sharing camp to confirm how far ahead the party is in the route and what's still left to clear.
**The approach:**
Davo's welcome is warm and entirely genuine in texture. He offers food, asks where they're at on the contract, makes a knowing comment about beast-clearing work that signals he knows exactly what job they're on — _"Brennan's lot? Good posting. Boring work but the Church pays clean."_ He suggests sharing camp. Makes sense. Efficient.
He is not wrong about any of this. He is also absolutely running a play.
**Reading them:**
Players who pay attention can notice:
- DC 11 Insight on Davo: Friendly and collegial, but asking very specific questions about how much of the route is already cleared and what's left ahead.
- DC 13 Insight on the logistics man: Quiet. Not participating. Making notes on a small piece of parchment.
- DC 14 Perception: Holt and Brek have positioned themselves to see the party's map or any documents without appearing to try.
- Calla is the tell. If a player makes genuine conversation with her, she is warm and uncomplicated — she mentions she's glad they got the posting because the Ironway crew could use a rest day. She hasn't been told the full plan. She thinks this is just networking.
**The night:**
Good company, genuine food, easy conversation. Davo has road stories. Nessa is dry and funny. Holt and Brek are decent enough. The plan — which the party may or may not have pieced together — is to get whatever information they need from the party's equipment or conversation, then set off before dawn and clear any remaining beasts on the route ahead of the party, arriving at Lowfield first to claim the contract completion.
It is not dangerous. It is just deeply annoying if it works.
**The play — before dawn:**
The logistics man wakes quietly and moves toward wherever the party's documents or route notes are stored. Holt stays awake on quiet watch. Davo sleeps — he genuinely believes this is fine and wouldn't lose sleep over it even if he didn't.
If the party catches it: Davo wakes immediately when called on it, sits up, and starts negotiating before he's fully upright. He is not going to fight over this. He will offer a cut of whatever the Church pays, claim it was all a misunderstanding, or simply accept being outmaneuvered with better grace than the situation deserves. He finds people who catch him more interesting than people who don't.
If the logistics man gets what he needs: the Ironway Company is gone before first light. The party arrives at Lowfield to find Davo already there, talking to Brennan's contact, being very charming about what a thorough job they all did together.
**Resolution options:**
- **Confront them tonight:** Davo negotiates. Something can be worked out. He's reasonable when cornered.
- **Let it play out and beat them there:** If the party moves faster or takes a smarter route, they arrive first. Davo, if encountered, shrugs and buys them a drink.
- **Report them to Brennan:** Davo will contest this loudly and creatively. The outcome depends on how much evidence the party has.
- **Recruit Calla:** She didn't sign up for petty contract theft and she knows it. If offered something straightforward, she'll take it.
**NPC — Calla** _(KAL-ah)_
- Early twenties, joined the Ironway Company because she needed work
- Competent with a short sword, better at reading situations than she lets on
- Hasn't done anything she's ashamed of yet and would like to keep it that way
- If treated with genuine respect by even one player, she remembers it
- _Potential future hook:_ Can reappear in later sessions as an ally, contact, or familiar face
**Achievements available:**
- _Caught Red-Handed_ — Identify and stop the logistics man before he gets what he came for
- _Beat Them To It_ — Arrive at Lowfield first regardless of what the Ironway crew does
- _Diplomat_ — Resolve the situation without confrontation
- _One More_ — Convince Calla to stay in contact with the party
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player genuinely likes someone in the Ironway crew and has to reckon with that when the plan becomes clear
- A player notices Calla's tells and treats her differently before the plan surfaces
- Someone confronts Davo and he immediately starts negotiating — funnier and stranger than a fight
- A player lets the whole thing play out and arrives at Lowfield to find Davo already there, cheerfully charming Brennan's contact

### Ironway Company — Statblocks (If Combat Starts)

_DM Note: The Ironway crew are not killers. If a fight breaks out it is because things went badly wrong — escalating tension, a player who pushed too hard, Davo miscalculating. They will fight to protect themselves but they are not willing to die over a contract dispute. Any crew member reduced to half HP or below will disengage and attempt to flee or surrender. Davo will call it off entirely if two or more of his crew are down._
_Combat CR target: The full crew together should be a Medium-to-Hard encounter for a standard party. Running them in subgroups (Holt and Brek engage while Nessa covers, logistics man bolts, Davo stalls) makes for a more dynamic fight than a straight brawl._
**Davo Irne** — _Leader_
_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 13 (leather armor) | **HP:** 38 (7d8 + 7) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 1
- **STR** 12 (+1) | **DEX** 14 (+2) | **CON** 12 (+1) | **INT** 14 (+2) | **WIS** 12 (+1) | **CHA** 16 (+3)
- **Saving Throws:** Dex +4, Cha +5
- **Skills:** Deception +7, Insight +3, Persuasion +7, Sleight of Hand +4
**Traits**
- _**Keep Talking.**_ As a bonus action, Davo can attempt a DC 13 Charisma (Persuasion or Deception) check against one creature that can hear and understand him. On a success, that creature has disadvantage on its next attack roll against Davo as his words momentarily break their focus. This has no effect on creatures that are already hostile and have been in combat for more than 2 rounds — they've heard enough.
- _**Read the Room.**_ Davo has advantage on Insight checks. If he beats a creature's Deception check during conversation, he knows they are lying — he may not know the truth, but he knows.
**Actions**
- _**Shortsword.** +4 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d6+2 piercing.
- _**Dagger (thrown).** +4 to hit, range 20/60 ft._ Hit: 1d4+2 piercing.
**Bonus Actions**
- _**Keep Talking** (see Traits)_
**Reactions**
- _**Tactical Withdrawal.**_ When a creature moves to within 5 ft. of Davo, he can move up to 10 ft. away without provoking an opportunity attack.
_Combat behavior: Davo does not want to be in this fight. He will use Keep Talking every round, stay mobile, and look for an exit. If he gets one, he takes it. He will not sacrifice himself for his crew — but he will not abandon them immediately either. He's calculating the whole time._
**Holt** — _Sword-and-Shield Fighter_
_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 16 (chain shirt + shield) | **HP:** 45 (6d10 + 12) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 2
- **STR** 16 (+3) | **DEX** 11 (+0) | **CON** 14 (+2) | **INT** 9 (−1) | **WIS** 10 (+0) | **CHA** 9 (−1)
- **Saving Throws:** Str +5, Con +4
- **Skills:** Athletics +5, Intimidation +1
**Traits**
- _**Shield Wall.**_ While Holt is within 5 ft. of Brek, both of them gain +1 to AC. This bonus is already reflected in Holt's AC above only when Brek is adjacent.
- _**Stubborn.**_ Holt has advantage on saving throws against being frightened or charmed.
**Actions**
- _**Multiattack.**_ Holt makes two Longsword attacks.
- _**Longsword.** +5 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d8+3 slashing (1d10+3 two-handed, though he rarely goes two-handed with a shield).
- _**Shield Shove.** +5 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d4+3 bludgeoning. Target makes DC 13 Str save or is pushed 5 ft. and knocked prone.
**Reactions**
- _**Brace.**_ When a creature moves toward Holt, he can set his shield and gain +2 AC against that creature's first attack this turn.
_Combat behavior: Holt is straightforward — he gets between threats and holds ground. He fights alongside Brek and isn't creative about it. He'll surrender before dying; he's been in enough scrapes to know when a fight is lost._
**Brek** — _Sword-and-Shield Fighter_
_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 15 (chain shirt + shield) | **HP:** 40 (5d10 + 10) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 1
- **STR** 15 (+2) | **DEX** 12 (+1) | **CON** 14 (+2) | **INT** 10 (+0) | **WIS** 11 (+0) | **CHA** 10 (+0)
- **Saving Throws:** Str +4, Con +4
- **Skills:** Athletics +4, Perception +2
**Traits**
- _**Shield Wall.**_ While Brek is within 5 ft. of Holt, both of them gain +1 to AC.
- _**Second Wind (1/Short Rest).**_ As a bonus action, Brek regains 1d10+2 HP.
**Actions**
- _**Multiattack.**_ Brek makes two Longsword attacks.
- _**Longsword.** +4 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d8+2 slashing.
**Reactions**
- _**Cover Holt.**_ When Holt is hit by a melee attack while within 5 ft. of Brek, Brek can use his reaction to impose disadvantage on the attack roll (declared before the roll is made).
_Combat behavior: Brek is slightly less confident than Holt but follows his lead without question. He fights defensively, uses Second Wind the moment he's below half HP, and watches Holt's back. He'll tap out when Holt does._
**Nessa** — _Archer_
_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 14 (leather armor + Dex) | **HP:** 32 (5d8 + 10) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 2
- **STR** 10 (+0) | **DEX** 16 (+3) | **CON** 14 (+2) | **INT** 12 (+1) | **WIS** 13 (+1) | **CHA** 10 (+0)
- **Saving Throws:** Dex +5, Wis +3
- **Skills:** Perception +5, Stealth +5, Survival +3
**Traits**
- _**Sharpshooter.**_ Nessa ignores half and three-quarters cover when making ranged attacks. Her ranged attacks do not suffer disadvantage from long range.
- _**Threat Assessment.**_ At the start of combat, Nessa identifies the most dangerous-looking target. Her first attack against that target has advantage.
**Actions**
- _**Multiattack.**_ Nessa makes two Longbow attacks.
- _**Longbow.** +5 to hit, range 150/600 ft._ Hit: 1d8+3 piercing.
- _**Aimed Shot (1/Turn).**_ Before making a Longbow attack, Nessa can take aim. The attack deals an additional 1d6 piercing damage on a hit, but Nessa cannot move before or after making this attack this turn.
**Bonus Actions**
- _**Disengage.**_ Nessa can Disengage as a bonus action.
_Combat behavior: Nessa starts at maximum range and stays there. She targets spellcasters or whoever looks most dangerous first. She will not engage in melee willingly — if someone closes with her she disengages and repositions. She's the most dangerous member of the crew in a straight fight and knows it. She's also the most likely to slip away cleanly if things go badly._
**The Logistics Man** — _Unnamed_
_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral_
- **AC:** 13 (leather armor) | **HP:** 22 (4d8 + 4) | **Speed:** 35 ft. | **CR:** 1/2
- **STR** 10 (+0) | **DEX** 15 (+2) | **CON** 12 (+1) | **INT** 13 (+1) | **WIS** 14 (+2) | **CHA** 8 (−1)
- **Saving Throws:** Dex +4
- **Skills:** Sleight of Hand +6, Stealth +6, Perception +4, Athletics +2
**Traits**
- _**Slippery.**_ The logistics man can take the Disengage action as a bonus action. He has advantage on ability checks and saving throws made to escape grapples.
- _**Light Fingers.**_ Any Sleight of Hand check made to pick a pocket, cut a strap, or take an item unnoticed has advantage.
**Actions**
- _**Shortsword.** +4 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d6+2 piercing.
- _**Dirty Trick.**_ The logistics man throws dirt, a flask of oil, or whatever is at hand at one creature within 5 ft. Target makes DC 12 Dex save or is blinded until the end of their next turn.
_Combat behavior: He runs. The moment a fight breaks out he is looking for an exit and will take it the first chance he gets. He only attacks if cornered, and if cornered he uses Dirty Trick immediately to buy himself room. He has never been anyone's idea of a fighter and he is at peace with this._
**Calla** — _Short Sword Fighter_
_Medium Humanoid (Human), Neutral Good_
- **AC:** 13 (leather armor) | **HP:** 28 (5d8 + 5) | **Speed:** 30 ft. | **CR:** 1
- **STR** 12 (+1) | **DEX** 14 (+2) | **CON** 12 (+1) | **INT** 12 (+1) | **WIS** 13 (+1) | **CHA** 12 (+1)
- **Saving Throws:** Dex +4, Wis +3
- **Skills:** Insight +3, Perception +3, Athletics +3
**Traits**
- _**Won't Start It.**_ Calla will not attack first under any circumstances. She only acts in combat if she or someone she cares about is directly attacked. If the party has treated her well, she may refuse to act at all — or actively step between her crewmates and the party.
- _**Clear Eyes.**_ Calla has advantage on Insight checks against creatures she has spoken with for at least 1 minute. She is very difficult to deceive.
**Actions**
- _**Shortsword.** +4 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d6+2 piercing.
- _**Disarming Strike.**_ On a hit with her shortsword, Calla can forgo the damage to force the target to make a DC 12 Str save or drop one held item of her choice.
**Reactions**
- _**Not Today.**_ If a creature within 5 ft. of Calla would be reduced to 0 HP by an attack, she can use her reaction to push that creature 5 ft. out of the way, potentially causing the attack to miss. She can use this to protect a player or a crewmate — her call.
_Combat behavior: Calla does not want to be in this fight and will make that clear. If the party treated her well during the evening, she will either sit out entirely or use Not Today to protect a player if an opportunity arises. If the party was cold or dismissive, she fights defensively alongside her crew but disengages the moment Davo calls a retreat. She is the one member of the Ironway Company who a player could realistically convince to stop mid-fight._

### Road Event 3 — The Cartographer

_Type: Strange Traveler_
_Location: The road, an hour or so from Lowfield — late afternoon, long shadows through the trees_
A figure comes around a bend walking toward them. Not quickly, not slowly — at the pace of someone who has been walking for a long time and stopped counting the miles. An older woman, sixties at least, dressed in practical layered wool. She carries an overstuffed canvas pack with several rolled map tubes protruding at different angles, and she is writing in a small bound journal as she walks, pausing occasionally to glance at the treeline, make a mark, and continue.
This is **Herath Soll** _(HEH-rath SOL)_, traveling cartographer. She has been mapping this road and the surrounding woodland for three weeks, updating a regional survey she first completed fifteen years ago. The world is peaceful enough now that work like hers is possible again, and she is making the most of it.
**Herath at a glance:**
- Completely at ease on the road alone, which she has been for most of her adult life
- Sharp in a way that doesn't announce itself — she will have already noticed several things about the party before she speaks
- Has no particular interest in their destination beyond its bearing on road traffic patterns
- Has strong opinions about the quality of the waystones on this stretch (poor) and the state of the road surface past the second ford (improving)
- Carries a regional map that is probably the most accurate document of its kind currently in existence
**The encounter:**
She finishes the line she's writing before looking up. Takes in the party — Church robes, hired escorts, one civilian — makes a note. Then nods.
_"Headed for Lowfield?"_
She'll answer questions about the road freely: conditions, distances, what's been moving through. She passed a six-person escort crew heading the same direction two days ago — heavy packs, moved like fighters. She noted them in her journal as potential road traffic data. She can describe them if asked (the Ironway Company, if the party hasn't met them yet).
If players ask about the woodland they've just come through: _"Ordinary mixed oak. Nothing unusual. I mapped the interior last week — it's clean. Animals, undergrowth, a badger colony near the second marker that I gave a wide berth."_ She produces her map without prompting if the conversation warrants it, worn at the folds and dense with notation.
If players ask why she's out here alone: she gives them a look that suggests she finds this question slightly puzzling. _"It's my job."_
**What she gives the party (if they engage):**
- Accurate road conditions for the remaining stretch to Lowfield
- Confirmation that the woodland is clear — she was through it recently and saw nothing that would concern a prepared escort party
- A note in her journal about the party, if anyone thinks to ask what she wrote: _"Group of eight, Church escort, Caldenveil direction. E-rank guides. One civilian, textile coat. Moving at civilian pace."_
- If a player mentions the Evergreen Forest: a slight shift in her expression — not fear, more like professional frustration. _"I've tried to map it twice. The distances come out wrong. My compass behaves incorrectly. I've stopped attempting it."_ A pause. _"Whatever lives in there, it doesn't want to be mapped."_
**What she doesn't give them:**
Conclusions or speculation. She observes and records. What it means is someone else's problem.
**After she moves on:**
She continues without looking back, stops twice more in the distance to make notes, and disappears around a bend. She was simply there, and then wasn't.
**Achievements available:**
- _Curious_ — Ask Herath at least three questions
- _Noted_ — Ask what she wrote about the party in her journal
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player asks something Herath doesn't know the answer to — she says _"I don't know"_ with no discomfort, and means it entirely
- A player tries to tell her something about the forest interior and she immediately opens her journal
- Someone asks if she gets lonely out here, and she thinks about it genuinely before answering
- Michael's comment about knowing her — a player follows up, he deflects warmly, the player notices the deflection

### Beat 3 — Lowfield, Again?

_Location: Lowfield, Past_
Lowfield is everything it was in the Present. Edna's cafe has a line out the door. Renwick is younger and moves faster and argues cheerfully with a neighbor about whose fence is whose. The Millstone is full. The pasture market is a social event as much as a commercial one.
Benno has both rooms available. The one that will eventually be kept empty and made up with particular care is currently occupied by a traveling merchant who leaves in the morning. Nothing about it is significant yet.
Edna does not have a sketch on her wall. That moment has not happened yet.
**Arthur and Tristan's visits:**
If the party is in Lowfield long enough — and they should be — Arthur and Tristan come through. Word spreads the moment they're spotted on the lane: the quiet man from the forest and his boy. Aunties emerge from doorways. Edna has something ready before they reach the counter. Tristan accepts whatever is pressed into his hands with quiet contentment and says nothing to anyone. Arthur smiles and thanks people and deflects questions about himself with the easy warmth of someone who has done it so many times it no longer requires effort.
This is the first time the party sees them. Arthur is alive. He is warm and present and entirely unaware of what is coming. Tristan is twelve and looks exactly like the sketch that hasn't been drawn yet.
Let the party have this moment without interrupting it. They know. Nobody else does.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player's face when they first see Arthur alive
- Someone who talked to Edna in Act 1 now watching her interact with Tristan — knowing what she will eventually keep on her wall

### Beat 4 — Arthur and Tristan

_Location: The Evergreen Forest / Arthur's House_
Getting to Arthur requires either following him from Lowfield back toward the forest or finding a reason to go into the forest directly.
Arthur is immediately warm with strangers. He invites people in without much prompting — it is simply his nature. The house is exactly what it looked like in the Present phase, but lived-in and full of light. Tristan moves around it quietly, doing whatever needs doing, watching the party with the careful assessment of a child who has learned to read people.
**Arthur in conversation:**
- Talks easily about the forest, about Tristan, about Lowfield
- Deflects anything about his past with practiced warmth — he has done this many times and is good at it
- If pushed seriously: _"I did something important a long time ago. I'd rather not be important anymore."_
- He does not know about the decree. He will not know until the inquisition is close.
- If the party tries to warn him: he listens. He does not dismiss it. He is a man who has seen enough of the world to take warnings seriously. What he does with the warning depends on how it's delivered and how much the party tells him.
**Tristan in conversation:**
- Does not speak to the party. Nods. Shakes his head. Accepts food if offered.
- Watches whoever is speaking with quiet, complete attention
- If a player makes a genuine effort to connect — sits near him, doesn't push, just exists in the same space — he may eventually acknowledge them with something small: a look, a slight shift toward them, once handing something back that they dropped without being asked
- Arthur watches this and says nothing, but something in his expression softens
**Training:**
Arthur trains in the cleared area outside the house every morning. If a player expresses interest, he will spar with them — not to test them, just because he enjoys it. He is not trying. He is not close to trying. He is also the most technically precise fighter any of them has encountered and this is immediately obvious.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- The moment a player realizes Arthur genuinely does not know what's coming — and chooses what to do with that
- A player who sits with Tristan without trying to get anything from him
- A player who tells Arthur the truth, or part of it, and watches him process it

### Beat 5 — The Inquisition Assembles

_Location: Caldenveil / en route_
The party becomes aware — through Brennan, through Church rumor, through their own observation — that the inquisition is fully assembled and moving. Adonis has received his order. The corridor is being finalized. The operation has a date.
**Adonis — first encounter:**
The party may encounter Adonis in Caldenveil before he moves toward the forest. He is not hiding. He is a Church Paladin on official business and he carries himself accordingly — present, deliberate, completely certain of his mandate.
He is not cruel. He does not relish this. He is a man who has been given an order by the institution he has served his entire life, and he has decided that his personal feelings about Arthur are not relevant to his duty. He buries it well. Not perfectly.
If the party talks to him — as hired contractors, as travelers, as anyone — he is direct and not unkind. If they probe about the operation: _"The Church has identified a threat. I've been asked to address it."_ If they mention Arthur by name: something crosses his face, brief and controlled, and then it is gone. _"I know who he is."_ Nothing more.
**The timeline:**
The party now knows when the raid happens and the route it takes. They have a specific window. What they do with it determines Beat 6.
**Options at this point:**
- Warn Arthur with enough detail that he can prepare or flee
- Sabotage the route enough to delay or redirect the inquisition
- Attempt to intercept Adonis and change his mind
- Do the job as hired and let events proceed
- Some combination of all of the above
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- A player who looks at Adonis and knows he is the man who kills Arthur — and has to decide how to feel about that given that he is, right now, not a villain
- The party's planning conversation — whatever they decide to do with the window they have

### Beat 6 — The Raid

_Location: The Evergreen Forest_
What happens here depends entirely on what the party did in Beats 1 through 5. This beat has no fixed script — only fixed endpoints.
**What is always true:**
- The inquisition comes. It cannot be stopped entirely — the Pope's decree exists, Adonis has his order, the Church's machinery does not simply halt.
- Adonis leads it. He will not be turned from the mission by words alone.
- The forest knows something is wrong before it arrives.
**What the party can change:**
_If they warned Arthur:_
Arthur has had time to prepare. He is not surprised. He has thought about whether to run or to stand, and whatever he decided, he decided it deliberately. The fight, if there is one, is on his terms rather than the inquisition's. This does not mean he wins — but it changes the shape of it. Arthur surviving is possible if the party is present and effective.
_If they sabotaged the route:_
The inquisition arrives delayed and fractured — some units took wrong paths, some were held up by the beasts left in place. Adonis and the core group still arrive, but they arrive without full support. The odds shift.
_If they did nothing:_
Events proceed as the Original Plotline describes. The inquisition finds Arthur and Tristan. The fight is long and devastating. Arthur uses the last of his power to teleport Tristan to safety. Arthur dies.
_If they attempt to intercept Adonis:_
Adonis will listen — briefly, genuinely — if approached by people who clearly know things they shouldn't. He is not a man who dismisses inconvenient information. But he has an order from the Pope and a faith that has structured his entire life. Changing his mind requires an extraordinary argument, evidence he cannot dismiss, or something that cracks the certainty he has built around this mission. It is possible. It is very hard.
**Running the raid:**
Do not over-script this. Set the pieces — Arthur, Tristan, Adonis, the inquisition, the forest — and let the players move through it. The key moments to hit regardless of outcome:
- The inquisition's arrival — the forest's reaction, the wrongness of Church soldiers moving through it
- Arthur's face when he sees Adonis — they know each other. That matters.
- The fight, whatever shape it takes
- Tristan watching
**If Arthur dies:**
He uses the last of what he has to get Tristan out. The teleport is not elegant — it is desperate, the magic of a man who has nothing left except one more thing to do. Tristan goes. Arthur does not follow.
The forest begins to change the moment Tristan is gone. Not immediately — gradually, like a color draining from something. The green starts going wrong at the edges.
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- Whatever the party tries in the moment — reward the attempt regardless of outcome
- Adonis after, if Arthur dies — he does not celebrate. He does not speak. He leaves.
- A player who stays in the forest after it's over and watches the color begin to change

### Beat 7 — Tristan's Awakening

_Location: Somewhere safe, far away — and the Evergreen Forest_
Tristan lands somewhere safe. Far from the forest, far from the Church, far from anyone who knows what he is. He does not know what has happened yet. He knows he was sent away. He knows his father sent him.
He waits. And then, at some point — the connection he has to Arthur, whatever a child has to the only person who raised them — something tells him. Not in words. Just in the way that certainty arrives sometimes, without evidence, without announcement.
Arthur is gone.
The grief that comes from Tristan in that moment is not something a twelve-year-old should be able to produce. It is not something a person should be able to produce. It is the grief of something that was promised a life and had it taken, expressed through power that has no upper limit and no training and nothing left to hold it back.
The Evergreen Forest, miles away, finishes changing color.
**What the party experiences:**
They are still in or near the forest when it happens. The change is not gradual anymore — it completes, fast and final, the green going to violet and black and deep bruised blue in the span of minutes. The air changes. The light changes. The animals flee.
The forest that was home to Arthur and Tristan for twenty years becomes the Twilight Forest. The same one the party walked through in Act 1. They are standing inside the moment it is made.
**Ending Act 2:**
However the raid resolved — Arthur alive or dead, Adonis confronted or not, the inquisition scattered or successful — the forest's transformation is the end of Act 2. The past has played out. What the party did in it has consequences that reach forward into Act 3.
Let the last image be the forest. Give it a moment. Then Act 2 is over.
**Achievements available across Act 2:**
- _Working Against It_ — Sabotage the raid corridor from inside the operation
- _Tell Him_ — Warn Arthur about the inquisition
- _Move Him_ — Successfully convince Adonis to hesitate or reconsider
- _He's Still Here_ — Keep Arthur alive through the raid
- _The Forest Remembers_ — Be present when the Evergreen Forest becomes the Twilight Forest
- _Sit With Him_ — Connect with Tristan without pushing
**Point Moments (DM Only):**
- Any player who carries the weight of knowing through the whole act — who plays their character as someone who knows how it ends and chooses anyway
- The party's conversation after the forest changes — what they say to each other when it's over
- Anyone who looks back at the house before leaving the forest for the last time

### Sword Art: Radiant Edge (5 WP)

Arthur performs his signature ten-strike sequence — a continuous, flowing technique that begins with pure swordsmanship and ascends into light itself. Each strike flows naturally into the next and must be performed in order. All attacks use +9 to hit.
_— Phase 1: The Foundation (Strikes 1–5) —_
**Strike 1 — Overhead Cut:** Arthur opens with a powerful downward strike from high guard, driving his blade straight down onto the target with his full weight behind it. Hit: 1d8+5 slashing. On a hit, the target has disadvantage on their next attack roll as they are forced to absorb or deflect the blow.
**Strike 2 — Cross Slash:** Riding the momentum of the overhead cut, Arthur pivots and drives a horizontal slash across the target's chest, exploiting the opening created. Hit: 1d8+5 slashing. On a hit, the target's AC is reduced by 1 until the end of the round.
**Strike 3 — Thrust:** Arthur redirects the cross slash into a forward lunge, driving the tip of his blade into the gap exposed by the previous two strikes. Hit: 2d6+5 piercing. On a hit, the target cannot take reactions until the start of their next turn.
**Strike 4 — Pommel Strike:** As the thrust retracts, Arthur steps inside the target's guard and reverses the blade, driving his pommel hard into the target's chin or chest. Hit: 1d6+5 bludgeoning. On a hit, the target must make a DC 17 Con save or be stunned until the end of their next turn.
**Strike 5 — Shadowstep Slash:** Using the target's staggered state, Arthur bursts around them and slashes across their back to close the first phase. He moves to any unoccupied space within 10 ft. of the target. Hit: 2d8+5 slashing, made with advantage.
_— Will ignites. The blade begins to glow. —_
**Strike 6 — Luminous Overhead Cut:** Arthur raises his blade once more, but this time light gathers along the edge as he brings it down — the force of the strike now amplified by his Will into something that can cleave through far more than flesh. Hit: 1d8+5 slashing + 3d8 radiant. On a hit, the target is outlined in light and cannot benefit from invisibility or cover until the end of Arthur's next turn.
**Strike 7 — Lightspeed Cross:** The cross slash returns, now so fast it appears to strike twice at once — a single swing that lands in two places simultaneously. Arthur makes this attack twice. Each hit: 1d8+5 slashing + 2d8 radiant.
**Strike 8 — Piercing Ray:** The thrust, now condensed into a focused beam of light that erupts from the tip of the blade upon impact, punching through anything in its path. This attack hits all creatures in a 30 ft. line behind the target. Each creature in the line makes a DC 18 Dex save, taking 4d10 radiant on a fail or half on a success. Ignores resistances.
**Strike 9 — Concussive Flash:** Arthur steps inside the guard once more, releasing a point-blank explosion of light on impact. Hit: 1d6+5 bludgeoning + 3d10 radiant. On a hit, the target must make a DC 18 Con save or be blinded and stunned until the end of their next turn.
**Strike 10 — Void Slash:** The final strike. Arthur vanishes — becoming light itself — and reappears at any point within 60 ft., delivering the finishing blow as a pure photon edge. This attack automatically hits, ignores all damage resistances and immunities, and deals 6d10 slashing + 6d10 radiant. If the target is below half HP, they must make a DC 20 Con save or drop to 0 HP.

### Tristan / Baal

- **Role:** Child, Demon King's Offspring
- **Affiliation:** None (lives with Arthur in the Evergreen Forest)
- **True Name:** Baal
- **Age:** 12 (Past Phase)
**Background**
- The offspring of the last Demon King, taken in by Arthur as an infant
- Raised in the Evergreen Forest under the name Tristan, presented to others as Arthur's adopted orphan
- Has lived a quiet, peaceful life — training, helping Arthur, and exploring the forest
- Suspects he is not fully human given Arthur is, but has never asked and doesn't particularly care
**Personality**
- Quiet and reserved — a child of few words
- Deeply loyal to Arthur, whom he considers his father in every way that matters
- Obedient and diligent in his training
- Content with his simple life; unbothered by questions of identity or origin
**Demonic Traits**
- Appears fully human at rest — demons only reveal their nature when drawing on their power
- When using magic, demonic traits begin to emerge: horns on his forehead, wings, red markings along his body, and glowing red eyes
- The more power he draws, the more pronounced the transformation
- Possesses innate super strength and superior physiology compared to humans even without magic
- Produces his own mana internally rather than drawing from nature or gods
**Magic**
- Partially trained under Arthur's guidance — has meaningful control but is far from his true potential
- His magic is innate and self-produced, making it fundamentally different from human spellcasting
- The full scope of his power is unknown, even to himself

### Statblock

_Medium Humanoid (Demon), Neutral Good_
- **AC:** 14 (natural resilience) | **HP:** 78 (12d8 + 24) | **Speed:** 35 ft.

- **Senses:** Darkvision 60 ft., Passive Perception 13
- **Languages:** Common, Abyssal (understands but rarely speaks either)
**Traits**
- _**Demonic Physiology.**_ Tristan's body is naturally superior to a human's. He has advantage on Strength checks and saving throws, and does not need to eat, drink, or sleep as often as a human.
- _**Innate Mana.**_ Tristan produces his own mana internally. His magic cannot be suppressed by antimagic effects that target external mana sources.
- _**Partial Transformation.**_ When Tristan uses any magic ability, his demonic traits begin to emerge (horns, wings, red markings, glowing red eyes). His AC increases by 1 and he gains 10 temporary HP when this occurs. If he uses two or more magic abilities in the same encounter, his transformation deepens — his AC increases by 2 total and he gains an additional 10 temporary HP.
- _**Suppressed Potential.**_ Tristan is not close to his true power. If reduced to 0 HP, the DM may choose to trigger an Awakening — see story notes below.
**Actions**

- _**Unarmed Strike.** +5 to hit, 5 ft._ Hit: 1d6+3 bludgeoning.
- _**Demonic Bolt.** Ranged Magic Attack, +4 to hit, range 60 ft._ Hit: 2d8+2 necrotic damage. Triggers Partial Transformation.
- _**Mana Burst.**_ Tristan releases raw demonic energy in a 10 ft. radius around himself. Each creature in the area makes a DC 13 Con save, taking 3d8 necrotic damage on a fail or half on a success. Triggers Partial Transformation.
**Reactions**
- _**Instinctive Block.**_ When hit by an attack, Tristan can reduce the damage by 1d6+3 as he instinctively braces with his demonic resilience.
**Story Notes (DM Only)**
- Tristan's true power as Baal is sealed behind grief and loss — it awakens fully upon Arthur's death, the canonical trigger described in the Original Plotline
- Upon Awakening, his transformation becomes permanent and overwhelming, and the Evergreen Forest changes color around him — a sign of the Demon King's power returning to the world
- Players in the Past phase may witness or even attempt to prevent this moment

### Michael

- **Role:** Archbishop, Mentor, Bearer of the Hero's Box
- **Affiliation:** The Church
- **Status:** Alive
**Background**
- A high-ranking Archbishop of the Church, tasked with traveling the world to find the next Hero
- Carries the Hero's Box — a magically sealed relic that can only be opened by a Hero Candidate
- Inside the box is a weapon uniquely suited to whoever opens it
- Currently traveling with Luna and John, training both as they journey from Stonewood to Lowfield
**Personality**
- Kind, patient, and warm — a natural teacher and father figure
- A wholehearted believer in the Church and its mission; his faith is genuine, not performative
- Believes deeply that anyone can be a Hero — it is not about birth or title but about heart and growth
- Consistently encourages John to try opening the box, seeing something in him that John doesn't see in himself
- Never pushy or forceful about it — he plants seeds and waits
**Relationship with John**
- Thinks of John as someone worth investing in — a low-ranking Church member he has taken under his wing
- Has no idea John is a Hero Candidate; his encouragement comes purely from his philosophy that anyone could be
- The moment John opens the box will likely be as surprising to Michael as it is to everyone else
**Relationship with Luna**
- Her direct superior and teacher
- Trusts her and values her steady presence on the road
**The Hero's Box**
- A magically sealed relic entrusted to Michael by the Church
- Glows with holy energy when a Hero Candidate touches it — they can feel it but cannot open it
- Only a true Hero Candidate can open it, revealing a weapon perfectly suited to them inside
- A Hero Candidate is not guaranteed to become a Hero — they have the potential but must still grow and prove themselves

### John / Raphael

- **Role:** Low-ranking Church Member, Unaware Hero Candidate
- **Affiliation:** The Church
- **True Name:** Raphael
- **Age:** 17–19 (Present Phase)
**Background**
- Born to a noble family that fled their house and renounced their title to live a quiet common life
- His parents' noble family never accepted their departure and has been hunting them ever since
- Grew up in a small village, living simply and far from his noble origins
- The village was destroyed by the Demon King's forces — Tristan, now fully awakened as Baal
- Raphael survived and disappeared into the chaos, adopting the name John and joining the Church as a low-ranking member
- The Church asks few questions, offers training, and puts him on a path toward the Demon King — the perfect cover
- His true goal is revenge for his village. He may also be hunting a specific demon responsible for the attack
**Personality**
- Brooding and closed off — keeps people at arm's length
- Says little, observes much
- Driven by a quiet, burning need for revenge that he rarely speaks about
- Not unfriendly, but not warm either — he tolerates people more than he welcomes them
- Beneath the walls, there is someone worth knowing — but he hasn't let anyone in yet
**Relationship with Michael**
- Genuinely respects Michael even if he doesn't show it much
- Michael's encouragement to try the box quietly irritates him — he doesn't see himself as anything special
- Deep down, Michael's belief in him is something he doesn't know what to do with
**Relationship with Luna**
- They bicker regularly — she gets under his skin more than most
- He would never admit it but her energy is something he finds grounding even when it annoys him
**Secret**
- His true name is Raphael, son of a noble family
- Someone from his noble bloodline is actively hunting him
- He joined the Church not out of faith but out of convenience and proximity to the fight against the Demon King

- John opening the Hero's Box is the key turning point of the Present phase — the weapon inside should feel meaningful and personal to the player
- His noble bloodline hunting him is a potential side arc or future complication
- His revenge goal puts him on a collision course with Tristan/Baal — a deeply layered confrontation given what the players will know from the Past phase

### Sir Adonis

- **Role:** Paladin, Church Champion, Former Hero's Companion
- **Affiliation:** The Church
- **Age:** Late 40s–50s (Present Phase)
**Background**
- One of the Church's greatest warriors, chosen to accompany Arthur on his journey to defeat the Demon King
- Fought alongside Arthur through the entirety of that campaign, forging a deep bond of brotherhood and mutual respect
- After Arthur's retirement, Adonis remained in the Church's service and rose to become its strongest Paladin
- When the Pope issued the decree to eliminate the Demon King's offspring, Adonis was chosen to lead the holy inquisition
- He tracked Arthur to the Evergreen Forest and led the raid that killed him — following his orders with conviction but not without cost
- Arthur's death at his hands is the wound Adonis carries quietly and alone
**Personality**
- Stern, disciplined, and unwavering in his duty
- A man of few words and absolute conviction — he does not second guess orders, but he feels their weight
- Deeply faithful to the Church and the Goddess, but the killing of Arthur has left a crack in his certainty he has never fully addressed
- Respects strength and courage above all else
- Not cruel — he takes no pleasure in violence, he simply does what must be done
**The Burden**
- Adonis does not speak of Arthur
- He executed his orders believing it was necessary to protect the world
- Whether he was right is a question he buries under duty and discipline
- If players in the Present phase push him on it, there is something underneath that hasn't healed
**Will — Stage III: Realization (Divine Wrath)**
- **Manifestation:** Raw physical force — his strikes hit harder than any man his size should
- **Awakening:** His Will is not mere strength but divine wrath — the Goddess's judgment made flesh, a force that grows more dangerous the longer a fight continues
- **Realization:** Adonis becomes the instrument of divine destruction itself — his body transcends its limits, pain and fear cease to exist, and every strike carries the weight of holy sentence

**Reactions**

- _**Will Parry (1 WP).**_ When hit by a melee attack, reduce the damage by 2d10+5.
**Story Notes (DM Only)**
- Adonis is morally complex — not a villain, but the man who killed Arthur and set the entire tragedy in motion
- In the Present phase he is a potential ally against the Demon King, creating a deeply uncomfortable dynamic for players who lived through the Past phase
- His Divine Wrath Will is a thematic contrast to Arthur's Light Will — wrath vs. grace, endurance vs. precision, the soldier vs. the chosen hero
- Whether Adonis ever fully reckons with what he did to Arthur is a story thread worth pulling

### The Demon General Mimic — Vael'shar, the Hollow

_True Name: Vael'shar_ (VAY-el-shar)*
_Title: The Hollow_
_Classification: Demon General — Infiltration & Assassination_
In its true form Vael'shar stands roughly eight feet, its body a shifting compression of shadow that never quite resolves into solid edges. It is not dramatically monstrous. It is wrong in a quieter way — proportions that drift slightly, a face that suggests features without having them, the impression of a figure observed through dark water. It moves without sound. It does not telegraph. When it decides to end something, that thing ends.

### Statblock

_Large Fiend (Demon), Neutral Evil_
- **AC:** 18 (shadow-dense form) | **HP:** 245 (28d10 + 84) | **Speed:** 50 ft.

- **Damage Resistances:** Cold, Fire, Lightning; Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing from non-magical attacks
- **Condition Immunities:** Charmed, Exhaustion, Frightened, Poisoned
- **Senses:** Truesight 120 ft., Darkvision 120 ft., Passive Perception 21
- **Languages:** All languages (does not speak unless choosing to deceive)
**Traits**
_**Shadow Form.**_ Vael'shar can move through any space as narrow as one inch without squeezing. It does not trigger pressure plates, motion sensors, or tripwires.
_**Flawless Mimicry.**_ Vael'shar can perfectly replicate the appearance, voice, scent, and surface-level mannerisms of any creature it has observed for at least 1 minute. Detecting the disguise requires a DC 28 Insight check. Truesight bypasses this automatically. Magical detection (such as _detect evil_) functions normally.
_**Premeditated.**_ Vael'shar always acts on the first round of combat, regardless of initiative. It cannot be surprised, and creatures attempting to ambush it must succeed on a DC 24 Deception check or Vael'shar is aware of the attempt before it begins.
_**Hollow Presence.**_ Creatures within 30 ft. of Vael'shar in its true form must make a DC 19 Wisdom saving throw at the start of each of their turns or become rattled — they have disadvantage on attacks against Vael'shar and cannot take reactions until the start of their next turn. Creatures that succeed are immune to this effect for 24 hours.
_**Shadow Anchor.**_ Vael'shar's shadow exists independently of light sources. It is always present and always correct — even in magical darkness, in full shadow, in featureless rooms. Creatures that observe this closely and succeed on a DC 16 Perception check notice something is wrong.
_**Legendary Resistance (3/Day).**_ If Vael'shar fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.
**Actions**
_**Multiattack.**_ Vael'shar makes three Void Blade attacks. It can replace one with Hollow Touch.
_**Void Blade.** +13 to hit, reach 10 ft._ Hit: 2d10+7 slashing + 3d8 necrotic. On a hit, the target's maximum HP is reduced by the necrotic damage dealt until they complete a long rest.
_**Hollow Touch (Recharge 5–6).**_ Vael'shar reaches into a creature within 5 ft. and touches something they are afraid of losing. The target makes a DC 19 Wisdom save. On a failure: 6d10 psychic damage and the target is stunned until the end of their next turn as their worst fear plays out behind their eyes in perfect, silent detail. On a success: half damage, not stunned.
_**Unmaking Strike (1/Day).**_ One attack that is declared before the roll. On a hit: 4d12+7 piercing + 4d12 necrotic, and the target must make a DC 21 Constitution save or be reduced to 0 HP. On a miss: Vael'shar still deals 2d12+7 damage as the blade grazes.
**Bonus Actions**
_**Blink Step.**_ Vael'shar teleports up to 60 ft. to an unoccupied space it can see. It does not need line of sight — only awareness that the space exists. This does not provoke opportunity attacks.
_**Read the Room.**_ Vael'shar studies one creature within 60 ft. Until the end of its next turn, it has advantage on all attack rolls and saving throws against that creature, and that creature has disadvantage on saving throws against Vael'shar's abilities.
**Reactions**
_**Counterstrike.**_ When a creature within 10 ft. misses Vael'shar with a melee attack, Vael'shar makes one Void Blade attack against them as a reaction.
_**Phase.**_ When Vael'shar would take damage, it can use its reaction to halve that damage and teleport up to 20 ft. in any direction. It cannot Phase and Counterstrike in the same round.
**Legendary Actions** _(3/round, taken at the end of another creature's turn)_
- **Shift (1 action):** Vael'shar moves up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
- **Shadow Lash (1 action):** One creature within 30 ft. makes a DC 19 Dexterity save or takes 2d8+7 necrotic damage and is knocked prone.
- **Wear Their Face (2 actions):** Vael'shar immediately assumes the appearance of one creature it can see within 60 ft. Until it uses this ability again or takes a bonus action to drop the form, it is indistinguishable from that creature to anyone without Truesight. Attacks against Vael'shar from creatures that cannot identify it as a disguise have disadvantage.
- **Full Presence (3 actions):** Vael'shar drops all pretense. Every creature within 30 ft. that can see it must make a DC 21 Wisdom save or be frightened of Vael'shar for 1 minute. Frightened creatures must use their movement to move away from Vael'shar on their turn. Creatures that succeed are immune for 24 hours.
**DM Notes (Act 1 Context)**
Vael'shar at full capacity is CR 18 — a creature that should not be fought by E-rank players. In the Act 1 encounter it is not at full engagement; it is executing a specific assignment (neutralize Michael, retrieve the Hero's Box) and treating the party as noise rather than opponents. When it strikes Emmet or Luna it is not being thorough — it is being efficient. It wants Michael's attention, not theirs.
Michael fighting it is not a fair fight. It is Michael buying time through experience, divine power, and the willingness to take damage he cannot fully absorb. The party running is the correct call. If they stay and fight, Vael'shar will demonstrate exactly why they shouldn't — precisely, without malice, the way a person swats something that landed on their arm.
Whether Vael'shar is eventually encountered again — in a different face, in a different city, wearing a form the party trusts — is entirely up to you.

## Locations
---

## Stonewood

A walled trade city situated at the edge of the Evergreen Forest, serving as the main hub between the surrounding towns and villages. Large enough to have a permanent Church presence, a busy market, and a professional city guard, but small enough that most long-time residents know each other by face if not by name.

### 🕯️ PRESENT

_20 years after the Demon King's return_
Stonewood's walls still stand. Its market still runs. The Church bells still ring on schedule. To a traveler passing through, it might seem like a city carrying on — resilient, even admirable. But spend a night here and something else becomes clear. The laughter is too quiet. The market stalls close earlier than they used to. People don't linger in the streets after dark. The Church is full not because of faith but because people have nowhere else to put their fear.
The war with the Demon King has not touched Stonewood's walls directly, but it has touched everything inside them. Refugees from smaller destroyed villages have swelled the population. Food is rationed quietly — not by law yet, but by the invisible hand of scarcity. The city guard has tripled in size but halved in morale. Crime has risen in the alleys the guard doesn't bother to patrol anymore. The Church preaches hope but the pews feel more like a shelter than a sanctuary. Stonewood is a city holding its breath.

### 🌄 PAST

_The era of peace following the Demon King's defeat_
Stonewood is a city that feels like a deep breath. The war is over, the Hero won, and the world is rebuilding. Trade flows freely through Stonewood's gates — merchants from distant towns, traveling craftsmen, pilgrims visiting the Church to give thanks. The market is loud and colorful. Children run between stalls. The guard is bored in the best possible way. The Church is well-attended out of genuine gratitude rather than desperation. The walls exist more as tradition than necessity — the gates are rarely fully closed. The city feels open, warm, and unhurried.

### Key Locations

### The Gate & Walls

_==Present==:_ The walls are a patchwork of old and new stonework — the newer sections darker, rougher, clearly added in haste during the early years of the war. Watchtowers have been installed at regular intervals along the battlements. The gatehouse is staffed by six guards at minimum with a sergeant present at all times. Travelers are questioned and bags are checked. Refugees are funneled to a separate processing area outside the eastern gate where they can wait days for entry. A notice board at the gate lists contraband items — the list has grown long.
_==Past==:_ The city walls are old but well-maintained — a point of civic pride. The gatehouse is staffed by two guards at most, and familiar faces are waved through with a nod. Merchants shout greetings as they pass. The gates close at sundown more out of habit than necessity. The whole structure feels more like a landmark than a fortification.
==**Captain Aldric — The Guard**==
_==Present== — Aldric, age 48, Captain_
- Rose through the ranks as older captains retired or died in the war's early chaos
- His wife Elara died of illness seven years ago. His son Cael joined the war effort eight months ago and he hasn't heard back.
- Runs the guard with iron efficiency. No tolerance for infractions. The warmth is buried deep.
- Privately knows the guard cannot hold the city if the Demon King's forces actually arrive — he is managing fear, not preventing disaster
- Has quietly authorized the guard to ignore Thornside Alley entirely — a decision that haunts him
- _Personality at the table:_ All business. Will cooperate with capable, legitimate players. Mention Cael at your own risk — it's the one crack in the armor.
_==Past== — Aldric, age 28, Sergeant_
- A young sergeant who takes his job seriously but doesn't have much to do in peacetime
- Patrols are quiet. His biggest concern is the occasional drunk merchant.
- Believes in law and protecting people — idealistic but not naive
- Has a wife named Elara and a newborn son named Cael. Talks about them constantly.
- _Personality at the table:_ Friendly and approachable. Will chat with travelers, ask where they're headed, and share a local tip or two.

### The Church of the Goddess

_==Present==:_ The largest building in the city, built from pale stone that glows faintly in the morning light. Inside, the pews are packed at all hours — families sleeping in the aisles, refugees huddled in side chapels. The Bishop delivers loud, urgent sermons about divine protection and endurance. The Church has become the city's de facto refugee processing center, food distribution point, and grief counseling office all at once. The staff is stretched thin and exhausted. The doors never close because there are always people who have nowhere else to go. The atmosphere is heavy — desperate prayers, quiet weeping, the smell of too many people in too small a space.
_==Past==:_ The largest building in the city, built from pale stone that catches the morning light beautifully. The interior is open and airy with tall windows and wooden pews worn smooth from decades of use. Services are joyful community events — singing, shared meals afterward, a genuine sense of gratitude for the peace the world has won. The resident Priest, Father Cedric, knows every family in the city by name. The doors are open from dawn to dusk and the atmosphere inside is warm, quiet, and welcoming.

### The Market District

_==Present==:_ A wide cobblestone square lined with stalls and surrounded by shop fronts. Half the original vendors have been replaced by refugees selling whatever they managed to carry out of their destroyed homes — secondhand tools, worn clothing, small personal items. Exotic goods are nearly gone. What remains is practical: food, basic supplies, cheap medicine. Prices have crept up on everything and nobody pretends otherwise. The atmosphere is transactional and tense. Vendors watch their stock carefully. Pickpocketing is common enough that most people keep a hand on their coin purse. The market closes an hour before sunset and the square empties fast — nobody wants to be caught outside after dark.
_==Past==:_ A wide cobblestone square that is the beating heart of the city. Loud, colorful, and fragrant — spices from the south, bolts of cloth from the east, fresh produce from surrounding farms piled high on wooden carts. Street performers work the crowd. Vendors argue cheerfully with each other over shared corners. Children chase each other between the legs of adults. The smell of roasting meat drifts from a corner stall that always has a line. The market runs from sunrise to an hour before sunset and the square stays lively long after it officially closes.

### Gareth's Smithy

_Location:_ A squat stone building near the city's northern gate, identifiable by the permanent haze of smoke above it and the rhythmic clang of hammer on anvil that starts before dawn. A wooden sign above the door reads "Gareth & Son."
_==Present==:_ The smithy runs day and night. The forge never fully cools. The interior is cluttered with weapon racks, half-finished orders, and scraps of metal covering every surface. The air is thick with heat and the smell of iron. Gareth himself is usually at the anvil, sleeves rolled up, face set in concentration. He speaks only when spoken to and even then keeps it short. The wait list for orders is pinned to the door — currently three weeks out.
- Longswords — 15gp
- Short swords — 10gp
- Spearheads (unhandled) — 4gp
- Chain shirt repairs — 5gp per session
- Arrowheads (bundle of 20) — 3gp
- Shields (iron-banded wood) — 8gp
- ⚠️ Custom orders suspended.
_==Past==:_ A tidy, well-organized smithy with tools hung neatly on the walls and a workbench clear enough to eat off. The forge burns steadily but not urgently. Gareth works at his own pace, chatting with customers, letting his apprentice Pip try his hand at simpler work under supervision. The shop smells of iron and sawdust. A stool by the door is usually occupied by whoever stopped in to talk.
- Farming tools (shovels, hoes, plough fittings) — 5sp each
- Horseshoes (set of 4) — 8sp
- Hunting knives — 1gp
- Basic iron cookware — 2–4sp
- Simple iron locks — 3sp
- Custom orders accepted, 1 week turnaround
==**Gareth — NPC**==
_==Present== — Gareth, age 50_
- The warmth has been worn out of him by two decades of weapon orders
- Has made more swords and spearheads in the last five years than in his entire previous career
- His apprentice Pip died in a village raid two years ago. The sign still says "& Son."
- Works from before dawn until after dark. Speaks little. Charges fair prices but no longer enjoys the work.
- Holds a quiet resentment toward the Church for not doing more but would never say it out loud
- _Personality at the table:_ Curt and efficient. Not unkind, just done with pleasantries. Will warm up slightly if players treat him with genuine respect or mention Pip.
_==Past== — Gareth, age 30_
- A broad, cheerful man who inherited the smithy from his father
- Known for honest prices and quality work — takes pride in everything that leaves his shop
- Teaching his apprentice Pip with genuine patience and obvious fondness
- Spends his evenings at the Hearthstone. Laughs loudly. Tips well.
- Has never made a weapon more serious than a hunting sword and is quietly proud of that
- _Personality at the table:_ Warm and unhurried. Happy to chat. Will throw in a free sharpening if he likes you.

### Mara's Stall

_Location:_ A corner stall in the market square, one of the few with a permanent wooden canopy. In the Present the canopy is weathered and patched with a handwritten price board at the front and a locked strongbox under the counter.
_==Present==:_ The stall is smaller than it looks like it used to be — the edges of the canopy show old attachment points where extensions once hung. Stock is practical and sparse: root vegetables, preserved meats, dried medicinal herbs. Mara stands behind the counter with the posture of someone who has been on her feet for twenty years and intends to stay there. She watches the square constantly — old habit, new purpose.
- Basic root vegetables and grain — 3cp per item
- Dried herbs (medicinal, limited) — 1sp per bundle
- Salted preserved meats — 5cp per portion
- Information — price negotiable
- ⚠️ Stock varies day to day. Exotic goods no longer available.
_==Past==:_ The stall is impossible to walk past — bright cloth draped over the canopy, dried flowers hanging from the frame, the smell of spices hitting you from ten feet away. Mara is usually mid-conversation with someone, gesturing enthusiastically over a pile of produce. Tomas works the back of the stall, restocking and quietly keeping track of everything his wife gives away for free to people she likes.
- Fresh seasonal produce — 1–3cp per item
- Dried herbs and cooking spices — 2–5cp per bundle
- Imported pepper and saffron — 5sp per pouch
- Honey (local) — 4cp per jar
- Wildflower bundles — 1cp
==**Mara — NPC**==
_==Present== — Mara, age 45_
- Tomas was killed when their village supply route was raided three years ago. Mara kept the stall because she had to.
- Still knows everyone's business but doesn't share it freely — information has value and she has learned that the hard way
- The warmth is still there but buried under exhaustion and grief. It has to be earned.
- _Personality at the table:_ Guarded at first. Opens up if players are respectful and spend coin. Once trusted, becomes one of the best information sources in the city — she sees everything from that corner.
_==Past== — Mara, age 25_
- Runs the stall with her husband Tomas, who handles restocking while she handles everyone else
- Loud, friendly, and impossible to walk past without stopping — the city's unofficial gossip hub
- Knows everyone's business and shares most of it freely and cheerfully
- Genuinely happy. Believes the world is good and says so often.
- _Personality at the table:_ Will call out to players as they pass, offer a free sample, and already know something interesting about wherever they came from.

### The Gatehouse

_Location:_ A two-story stone structure built into the city walls flanking the southern gate.
_==Present==:_ The interior has been converted into a full operations room. A large map of the surrounding region covers one wall, marked with pins indicating known demon activity and raided settlements. Guard rosters are posted beside it. The warm fire and casual atmosphere are long gone — this is a working command post. Captain Aldric is usually here when not on patrol, standing over the map with the expression of a man doing math he doesn't like the answer to.
_==Past==:_ The gatehouse interior is simple and comfortable — a guard post that doubles as a welcome point. There's usually a pot of something warm on the fire, a deck of cards on the table, and at least one guard asleep in a chair. Sergeant Aldric runs a tight enough ship but sees no reason to make his men miserable about it.
**Captain Aldric — NPC**
_==Present== — Aldric, age 48, Captain_
- Rose through the ranks as older captains retired or died in the war's early chaos
- His wife Elara died of illness seven years ago. His son Cael joined the war effort eight months ago and he hasn't heard back.
- Runs the guard with iron efficiency. No tolerance for infractions. The warmth is buried deep.
- Privately knows the guard cannot hold the city if the Demon King's forces actually arrive — he is managing fear, not preventing disaster
- Has quietly authorized the guard to ignore Thornside Alley entirely — a decision that haunts him
- _Personality at the table:_ All business. Will cooperate with capable, legitimate players. Mention Cael at your own risk — it's the one crack in the armor.
_==Past== — Aldric, age 28, Sergeant_
- A young sergeant who takes his job seriously but doesn't have much to do in peacetime
- Patrols are quiet. His biggest concern is the occasional drunk merchant.
- Believes in law and protecting people — idealistic but not naive
- Has a wife named Elara and a newborn son named Cael. Talks about them constantly.
- _Personality at the table:_ Friendly and approachable. Will chat with travelers, ask where they're headed, and share a local tip or two.

### Thornside Alley

_Location:_ A maze of narrow streets and cramped courtyards behind the market district, sandwiched between the backs of merchant buildings and the city's inner wall.
_==Present==:_ Thornside is now a dense, self-contained district that the city guard has quietly abandoned. Refugees have built lean-tos and partition walls between existing buildings, turning alleyways into corridors and courtyards into common rooms. Unlicensed vendors operate openly. There are at least two underground fighting rings, an unlicensed apothecary rumored to sell Church-banned substances, and an information brokering network operating out of a former cooperage at the far end of the main lane. It is not openly dangerous if you carry yourself right, but it is not safe either.
- Black market goods — negotiated
- Forged documents and travel papers — negotiated
- Information brokering — negotiated
- Unlicensed healing — negotiated
- Unofficial passage out of the city — negotiated
_==Past==:_ A narrow alley district of secondhand shops, cheap lodgings, and the occasional unlicensed card game. Mildly shady but nothing serious — the kind of place that has a reputation slightly worse than it deserves. The guard does a sweep twice a day and everyone tidies up accordingly.
==**Silas — NPC**==
_==Present== — Silas, age 42_
- The unofficial boss of Thornside Alley, running a network of smugglers, information brokers, and refugee fixers
- Not evil — genuinely helps desperate people, always at a price
- Has an uneasy truce with Captain Aldric: Silas keeps Thornside from boiling over, Aldric looks the other way
- Found in the back room of the former cooperage at the end of Thornside's main lane — you have to know to ask for him by name
- _Personality at the table:_ Calm, measured, sharply intelligent. Respects competence. Hates wasted time. Fair prices, always. Never does anything for free.
_==Past== — Silas, age 22_
- A small-time con artist running rigged games and short-changed trades in the market and Thornside
- Charming and quick-witted. Hard to dislike even when you know what he is.
- Has a loose network of street contacts and knows where things can be found for the right price
- Found at the back tables of the Hearthstone or near the market's east entrance
- _Personality at the table:_ Friendly and slippery. Will pretend to be something he isn't until pushed. Responds well to directness and coin. Has a good sense of humor about being caught out.

### The Hearth Inn

_Location:_ A two-story timber-framed building on the western edge of the market square. The ground floor is the common room and kitchen, the upper floor has eight rooms. A painted hearthstone above the door is said to have been blessed by a traveling priest decades ago.
_==Present==:_ The Hearthstone is overcrowded and showing its age. Rooms have been subdivided — what were private quarters now sleep three or four. The common room is full every night but not with celebration; it is the low murmur of people with nowhere else to go, nursing cheap ale and avoiding eye contact. The kitchen serves one hot meal a day and it runs out fast. The painted hearthstone above the door has become an impromptu shrine — small offerings of coins and flowers left at its base by guests who need something to believe in.
- Shared room (3–4 per room) — 4sp per night
- Private room (rare) — 1gp per night
- Common room meal — 8cp
- Ale — 5cp per pint
- Wine — 2sp per cup
- Stabling — 4sp per night
- ⚠️ Fully booked most nights. Arrive early or know someone.
_==Past==:_ The Hearthstone is lively and welcoming, the natural endpoint of any good day in Stonewood. The common room smells of roasting meat and woodsmoke. A local bard plays on weekend evenings. Travelers swap stories over ale. The innkeeper, a stout woman named Bess, knows every guest's name by morning and has an opinion about all of them. Rooms are clean, private, and fairly priced.
- Private room (single) — 5sp per night
- Private room (double) — 8sp per night
- Common room meal — 3cp
- Ale — 2cp per pint
- Wine (local) — 5cp per cup
- Stabling — 2sp per night

## Lowfield

A small, quiet farming village at the other end of the Evergreen Forest from Stonewood. The village sustains itself through farming, animal husbandry, and rural trade. Residents barter freely and sell surplus goods to passing merchants or make occasional trips to Stonewood. There are no walls, no guard. A few cafes and eateries serve as the social heart of the village.
Arthur and Tristan are regular visitors, coming to sell hunted game and pick up goods. They are warmly regarded — a sweet, quiet family everyone has a soft spot for. The village aunties have adopted Tristan as a collective source of joy. He never speaks to anyone in the village — he listens, nods, shakes his head, and accepts whatever is put in front of him with quiet contentment.
It was the aunties' offhand comments — _"I wish he'd stay this cute forever"_ — that Tristan took literally. Somewhere between intention and instinct, he used his demon magic to halt his own growth. He still looks twelve. He may always look twelve.

### 🕯️ PRESENT

Lowfield should not exist in its current state. Villages like it have been raided or abandoned. But Lowfield stands — farms tended, cafes open, smoke rising from chimneys. No demon has come within a mile of it. No soldier has ridden through demanding grain. The kingdom's army has tried twice and been turned back both times by things that can't quite be explained. The villagers count their blessings and keep farming. The older residents who remember Arthur and Tristan have their suspicions. They don't say them out loud.

### 🌄 PAST

Lowfield is unhurried, warm, and deeply communal. Market days are social events as much as commercial ones. Edna's cafe has the best bread within fifty miles and she knows it. Farmers argue about weather and soil. Children chase livestock through the lanes. Arthur and Tristan's visits are minor local events — word spreads fast and by the time they reach the main lane, aunties are already emerging from doorways with something warm to press into Tristan's hands.

### Key Locations

### The Village Lane

_Present:_ The main unpaved road through the heart of Lowfield, lined with farmhouses, small gardens, and handmade signs advertising eggs or wool for trade. Quieter than it used to be — a few houses sit empty. But the lane is swept, the gardens are tended, and smoke comes from most chimneys.
_Past:_ Busy and sociable. Neighbors call out across the lane. Chickens wander freely. The smell of baking bread drifts from Edna's cafe at all hours. Children use the lane as a race track. A cart is almost always parked somewhere it shouldn't be.

### Edna's Cafe

_Location:_ A low, wide building near the center of the village lane with a hand-painted sign that reads "Edna's" and a bench out front almost always occupied by someone with nowhere pressing to be. Four tables, a long wooden counter, and a kitchen that takes up more than half the space.
_Present:_ Edna is still there. Still baking. The menu hasn't changed in twenty years and she considers this a point of pride. The cafe has become an anchor for the village — people come not just for the food but because it feels like proof that things are still normal. She refuses to raise prices even as ingredients cost more, making up the difference by growing what she can and accepting barter.
- Fresh bread (loaf) — 3cp or barter
- Hot meal (changes daily) — 5cp or barter
- Tea or herbal drink — 1cp
- Pastry — 2cp
_Past:_ The best-smelling building in the village on any given day. Always full around mealtimes. Edna is behind the counter, opinionated about everything, generous to a fault with portions. Tristan is her particular favorite — he gets the largest slice of whatever is fresh without ever asking. She has never once heard him say thank you and has never once minded.
- Fresh bread (loaf) — 2cp or barter
- Hot meal — 3cp or barter
- Tea or herbal drink — 1cp
- Pastry — 1cp
**Edna — NPC**
_Present — Edna, age 68_
- Has run the cafe for forty years and plans to run it forty more
- One of the oldest residents and one of the few who openly says she thinks the village is being watched over
- Keeps a small sketch of Tristan on the wall behind her counter that a traveling artist made years ago — he still looks exactly the same in it, which she finds more comforting than strange
- Feeds anyone who comes through her door regardless of whether they can pay
- The emotional center of the village — if Edna is calm, everyone is calm
- _Personality at the table:_ Warm, sharp, completely unintimidated by anyone. Will feed players before asking a single question. Knows more than she lets on about why Lowfield has been spared.
_Past — Edna, age 48_
- In her prime and running the cafe at full tilt
- Has adopted Tristan as her personal project — always has something ready for him, always pretends it's nothing special
- The one who first said _"I wish he'd stay this cute forever"_ — she has no idea what she started
- Knows Arthur is not quite a normal retired farmer but has never asked and never intends to
- _Personality at the table:_ Loudly cheerful, impossible to refuse, always three steps ahead of the conversation. Will have already heard why the players are in Lowfield before they tell her.

### The Millstone — Inn

_Location:_ A sturdy two-story stone building at the edge of the village, named for the old millstone propped against its outer wall. Ground floor is a common room and small kitchen. Upper floor has three rooms.
_Present:_ Runs at half capacity — fewer traveling merchants come through now that the roads are less safe. Benno keeps the place immaculate out of habit and quiet pride. He has converted one of the three rooms into village emergency supplies — food, medicine, blankets — organized and maintained without being asked.
- Private room — 4sp per night
- Common room meal — 5cp
- Ale — 3cp per pint
- Stabling — 2sp per night
_Past:_ A comfortable, unhurried inn with steady business from traveling merchants. Benno always keeps Arthur and Tristan's usual room available without being asked — a habit that started after the third time Arthur arrived to find it taken.
- Private room — 3sp per night
- Common room meal — 3cp
- Ale — 2cp per pint
- Stabling — 1sp per night
**Benno — NPC**
_Present — Benno, age 55_
- Has run the Millstone his whole adult life, inherited it from his parents
- Quietly converted one room into a village emergency supply depot without announcing it to anyone
- Mentally tracks who in the village needs what and makes sure it happens without fanfare
- Still keeps Arthur's old usual room available. Has for twenty years. Doesn't explain why when asked.
- _Personality at the table:_ Calm, methodical, deeply kind in a practical way. Not a gossip. Will not share information about guests without a very good reason. Players who stay and treat the inn with respect will find him an unexpectedly valuable ally.
_Past — Benno, age 35_
- A steady, reliable innkeeper who takes quiet pride in running a good house
- Has a soft spot for Arthur and Tristan — always has their room ready, always has something extra on the tray
- Never asks Arthur about his past. Has pieced together more than he lets on from small details over the years.
- _Personality at the table:_ Friendly and accommodating without being effusive. Remembers how you take your tea after one visit.

### The Pasture & Farm Market

_Location:_ An open field at the northern edge of the village that doubles as an informal market on certain days. No stalls, no fees, no rules — people spread things out on carts and blankets and sort it out among themselves.
_Present:_ Still running, still informal. The variety is smaller but what's here is good. A few farmers have quietly started setting aside a portion of each harvest in the old barn at the edge of the pasture. Nobody organized this. It just happened. The village is preparing, in its quiet way, for something it doesn't want to name.
- Seasonal produce — barter or 1–2cp per item
- Livestock (chickens, goats) — barter or negotiated
- Eggs — 1cp per half dozen
- Wool and hides — barter or negotiated
_Past:_ Lively and social. As much a community gathering as a market. Arthur sells his hunted game here and is always surrounded by people wanting to hear about the forest. Tristan stands beside him, accepting whatever food people press into his hands, listening to conversations he has no intention of joining.
- All of the above plus hunted game (when Arthur is in town) — barter or negotiated
**Renwick — NPC**
_Present — Renwick, age 72_
- One of the oldest farmers in Lowfield, has worked the same land his entire life
- Knew Arthur as well as anyone in Lowfield did — respected him, never pried, shared ale with him on the bench outside the Millstone on warm evenings
- Has noticed that nothing bad ever happens to Lowfield and has a quiet theory about why — will share it with players who earn his trust slowly and patiently
- Quietly organizes the emergency supply stockpile without taking credit for it
- _Personality at the table:_ Few words, direct, unimpressed by status or urgency. Rush him and you get nothing. Sit down and let him talk at his own pace and you get everything.
_Past — Renwick, age 52_
- A hardworking farmer in his prime, respected by the whole village
- One of Arthur's few genuine peers in Lowfield — they don't talk much but there's a mutual recognition between them
- Has let Tristan help on the farm a few times. Tristan works hard and silently and Renwick appreciates both enormously.
- _Personality at the table:_ Gruff but fair. Generous with work and stingy with words. Warms up considerably after the second ale.

### Story Notes (DM Only)

- Lowfield is Tristan's emotional anchor — the place that represents everything Arthur taught him about living among people, being known, being cared for
- His protection of Lowfield in the Present is entirely personal and entirely silent — no demons know why they are not to go near it, they just know
- Players in the Present phase may notice that Lowfield is inexplicably untouched and begin to ask why — a thread that leads directly to understanding who Tristan really is beneath the Demon King
- Edna's sketch of Tristan — unchanged after twenty years — is a potential story moment if players notice it
- Renwick's quiet theory about the village's protection could seed Tristan's identity before players have figured it out themselves
- Tristan halting his own growth is an early sign of how powerful his magic truly is — he changed something fundamental about himself half by accident as a child

## Evergreen Forest / Twilight Forest

A dense forest that runs between Stonewood and Lowfield, bisected by a single road connecting the two. In the Past it is known as the Evergreen Forest. After Arthur's death, Tristan's grief and awakening power permanently altered the environment — the forest changed color, changed atmosphere, changed nature. It has been known as the Twilight Forest ever since. The road through it still exists but is no longer considered safe.

### 🕯️ PRESENT — The Twilight Forest

The Twilight Forest is not simply dark. It is wrong in a way that is difficult to articulate. The trees still stand. Things still grow. But the colors are off — deep purples, bruised blues, blacks where there should be green. The light that filters through the canopy is dim and strange, like perpetual dusk regardless of the hour. Animals exist here but they are not the animals of the Evergreen Forest. What lives in the Twilight Forest has adapted to it, and most of it is hostile.
Travelers who must cross between Stonewood and Lowfield do so quickly and in groups. The road is still passable but the forest presses close on either side and things move in the treeline. No one who has wandered off the road has returned with a full account of what they found. The Church has declared the forest cursed. Scholars call it a permanent magical anomaly. Neither explanation satisfies anyone who has actually been inside it.
Demons do not patrol the forest but they do not need to. The forest does the work for them.

### 🌄 PAST — The Evergreen Forest

The Evergreen Forest is beautiful, but not simply so. The trees are old and very tall, their canopy thick enough that the light reaches the forest floor in long, slanted beams. It is quiet in the way that deep places are quiet — not empty, but listening. Animals move through it freely. The undergrowth is dense but not threatening. The road through it is well-traveled and safe enough, though travelers who stray from it tend to find themselves turned around in ways that feel less like bad luck and more like the forest deciding.
There is an undercurrent to it that most people register without naming. Something about the Evergreen Forest feels inhabited in a way that goes beyond its wildlife. It is not frightening. But it is aware.
Arthur has lived here long enough to know every sound the forest makes. Tristan has grown up in it. To both of them it is simply home.

### Key Locations

### The Road

_Present:_ The single unpaved road connecting Stonewood and Lowfield still cuts through the Twilight Forest, but it is no longer a comfortable journey. The road is intact but the forest crowds it from both sides, close enough that branches overhang the path. Travelers report sounds from the treeline — movement, breathing, something that stops when you stop walking. The journey that once took a relaxed half-day now feels much longer. Most people move fast and don't look into the trees.
_Past:_ A well-maintained dirt road through pleasant woodland. Merchants use it regularly. Locals walk it without a second thought. Arthur and Tristan use it on their trips to Stonewood and Lowfield, usually with a cart of game. It passes close enough to their home that Arthur can cut through the forest from a familiar point rather than going all the way to the road's end.

### Arthur and Tristan's House

_Location:_ Deep in the forest, well off the road and invisible from it. Arthur built it by hand when he first retired — a sturdy wooden structure, not large, but carefully made. A main room with a fireplace, two small bedrooms, a covered porch, and a cleared patch of ground outside that serves as both a practice area and a place to sit in the evenings. The surrounding trees were chosen deliberately — old growth, widely spaced, the kind that let in enough light to make the place feel open even deep in the forest.
_Present:_ The forest around the house has been overtaken by the Twilight Forest's changes — the trees have darkened, strange vegetation has crept up the outer walls, and the clearing is rimmed with the same bruised, unnatural growth that defines the rest of the forest. But the house itself has been preserved. By order of Tristan, nothing in the immediate area of the house is to be harmed or intruded upon. Demons and creatures that roam the Twilight Forest give the clearing a wide berth — they do not know why, they simply do. The door is unlocked. Inside, the house is maintained. Not pristine, but cared for — the fireplace has been used recently, there are signs that someone has slept here, sat here, eaten here alone. Personal items remain exactly where they were left. Arthur's things have not been moved. A second set of belongings — sparse, practical — indicates Tristan returns. How often is unclear. The house feels less like a ruin and more like a wound that hasn't closed.
_Past:_ Warm and lived-in. The main room smells of woodsmoke and whatever Arthur has been cooking. Training equipment is stacked near the door. Tristan's small collection of things he has found in the forest — smooth stones, interesting bark, a feather — sits on the windowsill. The porch is where Arthur tends to sit in the evenings. It is a genuinely happy place, in the quiet way of people who have made peace with a simple life and mean it.

### Story Notes (DM Only)

- The transformation of the Evergreen Forest into the Twilight Forest is the most visible mark Tristan's grief left on the world — players in the Present phase who know what the forest used to be (from the Past phase) will feel the weight of it
- The house is Tristan's one act of preservation in a world he has spent twenty years reshaping through war — finding it should tell players something important about who he still is underneath everything
- If players reach the house in the Present phase, the undisturbed state of Arthur's belongings is a potential emotional moment — Tristan has not removed them, has not been able to
- The clearing's enforced safety is a hook: players who are being pursued through the Twilight Forest might stumble into it and find themselves inexplicably protected — and then have to reckon with why
- In the Past phase, the house is a place players may spend time in — it should feel like a real home, not a set piece

## Uniques
---

## Will
---

Will is an internal energy that exists within living beings, drawn from one's conviction, identity, and understanding of self. Unlike magic, which is external and learned, Will is intrinsic — it cannot be taught, only awakened. It manifests differently in every individual and is shaped entirely by who that person is.
**Stage I — Manifestation**
- The user becomes aware of their Will and begins to express it outwardly
- Enhances the user's physical abilities and weapon, taking on a general elemental or conceptual form (e.g. fire, wind, shadow, stone)
- The form is broad and instinctual — the user does not yet fully understand it
**Stage II — Awakening**
- The user comes to understand the true nature of their Will
- The broad form sharpens into something personal and distinct through introspection and often a defining moment of clarity
- Example: Fire → Explosions, Lasers, Burning Away Impurity, or even Healing through Renewal
- No two Awakenings are exactly the same, even if two users began with the same manifestation
**Stage III — Realization**
- The user realizes their Will fully onto themselves and the world
- They do not merely wield their Will — they embody it
- The user transcends the original form, wielding the underlying concept in its purest expression
- Example: Explosion Will → can detonate anything. Light Will → the user becomes light itself
**DM Notes**
- Will is a spectrum. Many fighters never reach Manifestation. Awakening is rare. Realization is near-mythical.
- Will and magic are distinct systems and do not interfere with each other, though a user can theoretically possess both.
- Will is unique to this world. Other worlds may have analogous systems (Qi, Aura, etc.) but the specific stages and expression of Will are native to this setting only.

## Magic
---

Magic is the manipulation of mana — an energy that exists throughout the world in different forms depending on its source. How a being accesses mana defines the nature of their magic entirely. Humans and demons draw on mana in fundamentally different ways, and neither can replicate the other's method.
**How Humans Use Magic**
Humans are conductors. They do not generate mana themselves — instead they draw it from external sources and channel it through their bodies to produce magical effects. The three sources humans can draw from are nature, spirits, and gods.
- **Nature** is the most common source — the ambient mana that flows through living things, water, earth, and air. Most human spellcasters use this without thinking about it, the way a person breathes without thinking about their lungs.
- **Spirits** are entities that exist alongside the natural world. A human who has formed a relationship with spirits can draw on their mana directly, often producing magic with a distinctly different character — older, stranger, more unpredictable.
- **Gods** grant mana to those who serve them through faith and devotion. Divine magic is the most structured and the most powerful at its ceiling, but it is also the most conditional — it flows through the relationship between the caster and their god, and that relationship can be strained.
Most humans draw from only one source. A rare few can draw from two, and drawing from all three simultaneously is essentially unheard of. Those who can access multiple sources tend to have magic that is unusually versatile but harder to master.
**Running Out of Mana**
Because humans draw from external sources rather than generating their own, their available mana at any given moment depends on their connection to that source and how much they have already channeled. Sustained spellcasting, high-intensity magic, or being cut off from one's source can deplete a human's ability to draw further.
Reaching empty is exhausting but survivable. Pushing past empty is not. A human who forces magic through a depleted channel is drawing on something they don't have — burning through the connection itself rather than what flows through it. The consequences range from physical collapse and lasting injury to permanent damage to their ability to use magic at all. In extreme cases it is fatal. This is not a theoretical risk. It happens, and practitioners know it.
**Environments Where Human Magic Fails**
Human magic requires a connection to its source. Sever that connection and the magic stops.
Places that are cut off from nature — deeply corrupted land, sealed vaults, areas of concentrated antimagic — can weaken or entirely block a nature-drawing caster. The Twilight Forest is a particular case: Tristan's awakening so thoroughly altered the environment that the natural mana flow within it is distorted and unreliable. Human spellcasters who enter the Twilight Forest often find their magic sluggish, inconsistent, or failing at the worst moments.
Divine magic is similarly affected by places of corrupted or opposing spiritual presence. A priest of the Goddess casting inside a site consecrated to something else may find their connection muffled.
**How Demons Use Magic**
Demons generate and store their own mana internally. They are self-contained — their magic does not depend on their environment, cannot be blocked by cutting off an external source, and does not fluctuate based on where they are. A demon casts the same in a dead wasteland as in a lush forest.
The tradeoff is that what a demon has is what they have. Their mana regenerates over time but it is finite in a way that human mana, drawn from an essentially boundless external source, is not. A demon in a prolonged fight is spending from a reserve. A human in the same fight is drawing from a well that refills on its own — provided the well is accessible.
Demon mana has a different character to human mana. It is denser, more self-directed, and carries an intrinsic quality tied to the demon's nature. This is why antimagic effects that suppress external mana sources do not work on demons — there is no external source to cut off.
**The Barrier Between Systems**
Humans cannot generate internal mana. No amount of training, ritual, or augmentation allows a human to produce mana from within themselves the way a demon does. Likewise, demons do not naturally form the kind of open external channels that allow a human to draw from nature or gods — their magic is by definition closed and internal.
This means the two systems are entirely separate in practice. A demon cannot receive divine magic. A human cannot use innate demon-style casting. There is no overlap, no hybrid, no exception that has been reliably documented.
**Visible Effects**
Magic has a visible component when cast. The appearance varies by source and caster — nature magic tends toward greens and golds, divine magic toward white and pale light, spirit magic toward silver or shifting iridescence. Demon magic is typically darker in hue, often red, black, or deep violet, and has a denser, more physical quality to its visual presence. Experienced observers can identify a caster's source and sometimes their affiliation from the look of their magic alone.

## Gods & Spirits
---

There are three powers that sit above the world without quite being part of it — the Goddess of Light, the God of Darkness, and the Spirit King. Each is vast enough that scholars argue about whether they are truly comparable, but in practice they occupy the same tier. None commands the others. None is known to have tried.

### Gods

The gods are distant. They do not walk the world, do not speak plainly, and do not intervene in ways that are easy to point to. Their presence is felt through the people and institutions that serve them — through the blessings they grant, the magic that flows from devotion to them, and the rare chosen individuals who carry their mandate into the world. When a god acts, it is almost always through someone else.
Whether this distance is a choice, a limitation, or something else entirely is a matter of ongoing theological debate that has never been resolved.
**Aelura** _**(ay-LOO-rah)**_ **— The Goddess of Light**
- The god of the Church, of heroes, of protection and order
- Her followers believe she actively cares about the world and its people — that her distance is patience, not indifference
- She chooses Heroes — individuals granted her blessing and mandate to act on her behalf at critical moments
- Divine magic drawn from her tends toward white and pale gold in appearance, structured and warm
- The Church is her primary institution, though not every person of faith operates through the Church
- Her relationship with Urathos is not explained in any text the Church acknowledges as authoritative. She has never, as far as anyone knows, spoken of him directly through any of her chosen.
**Urathos** _**(oo-RAH-thos)**_ **— The God of Darkness**
- Less understood and far less institutionalized than Aelura
- Has followers, but no single dominant organization comparable to the Church
- Is not universally considered evil — some traditions hold that darkness is simply the other half of what light is, neither lesser nor opposed
- His chosen, if he has them, are not publicly known or recognized as such
- Divine magic drawn from him tends toward deep blacks and cold silvers, quieter in appearance than light magic but no less potent
- The nature of his relationship with Aelura is one of the world's genuinely open questions. Scholars, priests, and philosophers have argued about it for centuries. The most honest answer is that no one knows — and any source that claims certainty is almost certainly projecting.
**Minor Gods under Aelura**
- **Vessa** _(VES-ah)_ — Goddess of Oaths & Contracts. Invoked when binding promises are made. Her name is used in formal vows and legal proceedings. Breaking an oath sworn in Vessa's name is considered one of the gravest acts a person can commit.
- **Calder** _(KAL-der)_ — God of Healing & Recovery. Patron of physicians, battlefield medics, and those who tend to the sick. Healers who draw divine magic often find it flows more readily when Calder is invoked.
- **Sorin** _(SOR-in)_ — God of Courage & Resolve. Soldiers whisper his name before a charge. Not a god of war — he governs the interior act of choosing to go forward when everything says to stop.
- **Lirien** _(LIR-ee-en)_ — Goddess of Mercy & Forgiveness. Invoked in last rites and in moments of clemency. Her worship is quiet and personal — she has no grand temples, only small shrines in the corners of churches and homes.
**Minor Gods under Urathos**
- **Vael** _(VAYL)_ — God of Secrets & Hidden Things. Worshipped by those who deal in information, by spies, and by those who must hide who they are. He does not judge what is concealed — only that it is concealed well.
- **Nara** _(NAH-rah)_ — Goddess of Grief & Memory. Not malevolent — she is the one who tends to the weight of loss. Mourners sometimes leave offerings at unmarked stones for her. She is considered the reason the dead are not forgotten.
- **Ossyr** _(OS-sir)_ — God of Endings & Thresholds. He governs the crossing between death and what comes after, not death itself. Distinct from violence or destruction — Ossyr is invoked at the close of things: the end of a journey, the last day of a life, the moment a door shuts for the final time.
- **Thessan** _(THES-an)_ — God of Ambition & Hunger. Patron of those who want more than they were given. Not inherently evil but his worship tends toward obsession. The Church considers him dangerous. His followers consider that the point.

### Spirits

Spirits are a separate category of being entirely. They are not gods and do not think of themselves as such. They are older presences — entities that have existed alongside the natural world for as long as the natural world has existed, each one tied to a specific element, place, or force. They do not govern in the way gods do. They simply are.
The Spirit King sits at the head of this hierarchy, roughly equal in scope and power to the major gods. He is not worshipped in the way gods are, but he is respected — by those who know enough to do so. His relationship with the Goddess and the God of Darkness is one of mutual recognition and apparent non-interference. There is no known conflict between the three powers, and no known alliance either.
**The Spirit King**
- The sovereign of all spirits, and the oldest of them
- Does not involve himself in human affairs as a rule, but is aware of them
- Humans who draw mana from spirits are, in a sense, drawing from a system that ultimately flows from him — though most casters never interact with him directly and many don't know he exists
- His appearance, nature, and motivations are largely unknown outside of spirit-affiliated traditions
**The Major Spirit Guardians**
- A tier of powerful spirits beneath the Spirit King, each governing a specific element
- They are not gods and do not grant divine magic — humans who draw from spirits are drawing ambient elemental mana, not receiving a blessing
- Each Guardian has a distinct character tied to their element. They can be communicated with, bargained with, and in rare cases form genuine bonds with human practitioners — but they are not warm in the way gods are imagined to be. They are elemental in the truest sense.
- There are four Major Spirit Guardians, each governing a primary element. They are ancient, distinct, and not easily categorized as benevolent or hostile — they are elemental in the truest sense, and interact with humans entirely on their own terms.

### Solrath — Guardian of Fire (SOL-rath)

_Appearance:_ A towering figure of condensed flame, shifting between the shape of a man and something far older. His face is calm in the way a wildfire is calm — not still, but inevitable.
_Personality:_ Proud, direct, and intensely present. Solrath does not waste words and does not tolerate timidity. He respects those who act with conviction, even if he disagrees with the action. He has a dry, sharp humor that surfaces unexpectedly. Of the four Guardians he is the most likely to engage with humans on something resembling equal footing — not because he thinks they are equals, but because he finds them interesting when they stop being afraid of him.
_What he values:_ Courage, decisiveness, and honesty. No patience for hesitation or false modesty. Responds well to people who want something and say so plainly.
_Blessings he grants:_
- Fire mana that burns hotter and more controlled than ambient flame — precise enough to be surgical or broad enough to be devastating
- Resistance to heat and fire damage
- The ability to sense heat sources and emotional intensity in nearby creatures — Solrath's fire reads passion as well as temperature
- At deeper bonds: the ability to call flame from nothing rather than needing an existing source, and to briefly transform strikes or touch into fire

### Nerathi — Guardian of Water (neh-RAH-thee)

_Appearance:_ A fluid, shifting form that never fully settles — sometimes a woman made of still deep water, sometimes a current, sometimes barely visible at all. Her eyes are the only constant: dark and depthless.
_Personality:_ Patient to a degree that humans often mistake for coldness. Nerathi observes before she speaks, speaks carefully when she does, and rarely repeats herself. She is not unkind but she is not warm — she is deep, and depth is not always comfortable. She holds a long memory and a long view. Of the four Guardians she is the hardest to form a bond with, not because she refuses but because she waits to see if the person is serious.
_What she values:_ Patience, adaptability, and genuine emotional honesty. She distrusts people who perform more than they feel.
_Blessings she grants:_
- Water mana with exceptional versatility — it can heal, erode, flow around obstacles, or strike with the force of a current depending on how it is shaped
- The ability to breathe and move freely underwater
- Heightened intuition about people's true emotional states — Nerathi's water reads depth
- At deeper bonds: the ability to pull moisture from air or ground without a water source present, and to use water as a scrying medium to observe distant places she has touched before

### Vaelor — Guardian of Wind (VAY-lor)

_Appearance:_ Rarely fully visible — most often a presence in moving air, a voice from no direction in particular, or a briefly glimpsed silhouette moving fast through the sky. When he fully manifests he appears as a lean, sharp-featured figure with hair and clothes in constant motion regardless of whether there is wind.
_Personality:_ Restless, curious, and easily bored by anything that sits still too long. The most talkative of the four Guardians and the most unpredictable — he might answer a question with a question, disappear mid-conversation, or show up uninvited to offer an opinion nobody asked for. He is not malicious but he is capricious. He likes people who surprise him and loses interest in people who don't.
_What he values:_ Curiosity, adaptability, and a willingness to change direction. No respect for rigidity and a deep instinctive dislike of anything that tries to contain things unnecessarily.
_Blessings he grants:_
- Wind mana with emphasis on speed and precision — cutting, launching, redirecting, and moving through space faster than should be possible
- Enhanced agility and reaction speed
- The ability to muffle sound around oneself or project it across distances
- At deeper bonds: the ability to briefly ride wind currents over short distances as if flying, and to sense anything carried on the wind — sound, scent, the movement of distant creatures

### Gorrath — Guardian of Earth (GOR-rath)

_Appearance:_ Massive and still. A figure of stone and packed soil, slow-moving in the way that mountains are slow-moving — not incapable of speed, simply uninterested in it. Moss grows on his shoulders. His voice resonates in the chest more than the ears.
_Personality:_ The quietest and most deliberate of the four. Gorrath does not rush, does not raise his voice, and does not change his mind easily — but when he does it is because he has thought about it fully and means it. The most straightforwardly reliable of the Guardians. He has a deep, slow affection for things that endure — old trees, old stone, old bonds. His humor surfaces rarely and lands like a boulder.
_What he values:_ Steadfastness, honesty, and endurance. No interest in cleverness for its own sake. Responds to people who are where they say they will be and do what they say they will do.
_Blessings he grants:_
- Earth mana with emphasis on defense, weight, and permanence — raising barriers, anchoring ground, striking with immovable force
- Significant physical resilience — harder to move, harder to wound
- The ability to sense through ground contact — feeling vibrations, the movement of creatures, the structure of stone and soil nearby
- At deeper bonds: the ability to reshape earth and stone directly without a spell framework, and to root oneself in place in a way that makes forced movement nearly impossible

### Spirits in General

- Below the Major Guardians are countless lesser spirits — small presences tied to specific rivers, groves, mountains, weather patterns, or animals
- These are the spirits most human mana-drawers are actually interfacing with, often without knowing it
- A practitioner who cultivates a deliberate relationship with spirits — rather than simply drawing ambient mana — can access stronger and more stable flows, and may eventually come to the attention of a Major Guardian
