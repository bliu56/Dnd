## Summary

Ruled by a kind and wise king, this realm operated under a fragile balance of power between the Royal Faction and the Noble Faction.
During the war, fractures within the noble class widened. Several powerful aristocrats, driven by greed and fear, secretly sided with the demons in exchange for promises of survival or dominion. These betrayals cost countless lives.
As the war dragged on, evidence of treason surfaced. With the support of the king and war heroes, the most corrupt nobles were purged or stripped of power. The Noble Faction survived, but permanently weakened, while royal authority emerged dominant in the post war era.

## The Royal Family

- **Prince Caelum** _(KAY-lum)_

    The eldest child and heir to the throne. Calm, disciplined, and heavily burdened by expectation, Caelum was the primary target of noble political maneuvering.

- **Princess Elowen** _(EL-oh-wen)_

    The elder daughter, known for her sharp intellect and diplomatic talent. Many nobles underestimated her, often to their regret.

- **Princess Mireya** _(mih-RAY-uh)_

    The youngest, beloved by the people for her warmth and presence. Her popularity made her a symbolic prize among ambitious houses.

- **King Altharion III** _(al-THAIR-ee-on)_,

    Known in history as _the Gilded Lion_.

- **Queen Seraphine** _(SEH-rah-feen)_

## The Five Pillars of Aurelion

The crown’s true strength lay not only in lineage, but in loyalty.
These were the greatest defenders of the realm, sworn directly to the king and operating beyond noble authority.
1. **Sir Aldric Veynholm** _(AL-drik VAYN-holm)_

    _First Pillar, Swordsmaster_

    A peerless duelist whose techniques shaped modern Aurelion swordplay. He served as both champion and master-at-arms to the royal guard.

1. **Lady Thessa Windmere** _(THESS-uh WIND-meer)_

    _Second Pillar, Master Archer_

    A former hunter turned battlefield commander. Her long range tactics often determined the outcome of entire campaigns before armies clashed.

1. **Archmage Corvellan Rhys** _(kor-VELL-an REES)_

    _Third Pillar, Grand Magician_

    A towering figure in arcane theory and war magic. He believed that magic without discipline was the root of societal collapse.

1. **Sir Garron Stoneward** _(GAIR-on STONE-ward)_

    _Fourth Pillar, Steadfast Guardian_

    Commander of the Shieldbearers and personal protector of the royal family. Known for holding a fortress gate alone for three days during a border uprising.

1. **The Last Shadow**

    _Fifth Pillar_

    Officially nonexistent.

    Whispers speak of a hidden agent who removed threats before they reached the throne. Only the king, queen, and the First Pillar were said to know the Shadow’s true identity.

Beyond the Pillars, the king commanded a professional standing army, loyal advisors, veteran strategists, and lifelong companions forged through shared campaigns.

## The Noble Faction

## Summary

Aurelion’s noble houses were wealthy, influential, and deeply divided.
Different families controlled banks, merchant guilds, trade fleets, arcane academies, mercenary legions, and private armies. Though they presented a unified front against royal reform, they constantly undermined one another through economic sabotage, espionage, and political manipulation.
Marriage was their favored weapon.
- Noble daughters were encouraged to court **Prince Caelum**, aiming to bind the crown to their house.
- Noble sons were pushed toward **Princess Elowen** or **Princess Mireya**, seeking influence through proximity.
King Altharion allowed these maneuvers to continue. He understood that as long as the nobles competed with one another, they could never truly unite against the crown.

## Post War Reforms Affecting the Houses

No noble house may maintain a private army above crown regulated limits.
Banking and arcane research are subject to royal audit.
Noble succession laws require crown approval.
Treason trials are now conducted by joint royal noble tribunals.

## The Age of Veiled Crowns

The Kingdom of **Aurelion** _(aw-REL-ee-on)_ was long regarded as the most stable realm on the continent. Its banners flew unchallenged, its laws were respected, and its throne appeared unassailable.
Beneath that stability, however, lay a quiet struggle for power.
At the center of the realm ruled **King Altharion III** _(al-THAIR-ee-on)_, known in history as _the Gilded Lion_. He was a ruler of patience and foresight, favoring restraint over force and long planning over short victories.
By his side stood **Queen Seraphine** _(SEH-rah-feen)_, a woman of keen political intuition. She possessed an unmatched understanding of noble alliances and rivalries, often seeing betrayal before it fully formed.

## Betrayal During the Great War

When the Demon King’s influence spread, it found willing listeners among the most ambitious nobles.
Promises of survival, dominion, and future power tempted those who believed the war could be exploited rather than endured. Supply lines were sabotaged. Defensive plans were leaked. Assassination attempts came dangerously close to success.
On multiple occasions, Aurelion stood at the edge of collapse.
Only the intervention of the summoned hero, the vigilance of the Five Pillars, and decisive action by the king prevented disaster. Several noble houses were exposed as traitors. Their titles were revoked, assets seized, and in the most extreme cases, their names erased from official history.
The Noble Faction emerged broken and diminished.

## Present Account

## The Golden Concord

After the Demon King’s defeat, **King Altharion III** enacted sweeping reforms designed not as punishment, but as prevention.
A formal system of checks and balances was established.
- Noble authority became transparent and regulated.
- Military command was centralized under the crown.
- Economic monopolies were dismantled.
- Governance councils were formed, consisting of royal representatives, vetted nobles, and neutral magistrates.
The surviving noble houses adapted. Greed did not vanish, but it was constrained. Cooperation replaced intrigue, as unchecked ambition had nearly destroyed the realm.
**Prince Caelum** _(KAY-lum)_ now serves as Crown Regent, overseeing internal governance while preparing for kingship.
**Princess Elowen** _(EL-oh-wen)_ leads foreign diplomacy.
**Princess Mireya** _(mih-RAY-uh)_ stands as a symbol of reconciliation and unity.
The Five Pillars remain active, though the **Last Shadow** is rumored to have vanished after the war. Some believe their duty is complete. Others believe they simply wait.
Aurelion now stands in a true golden age, maintained not by fear, but by balance.
