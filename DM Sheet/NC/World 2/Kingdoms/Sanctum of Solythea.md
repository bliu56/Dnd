## Summary

This kingdom worshipped a pantheon unified under a Supreme God. While other gods were honored, all were understood to serve the divine will of the Supreme God.
Leadership flowed through a strict religious hierarchy. The High Priestess stood at the apex, followed by elders, bishops, and clergy.
The war was interpreted as a divine trial. Their armies and miracle wielders fought with fanatic resolve, believing victory or extinction to be equally holy outcomes. Their faith strengthened during the war, and their religious authority expanded afterward.

## Hierarchy

1. **High Priestess** – Supreme authority in both spiritual and temporal matters.

    - Guides the kingdom, interprets the Supreme God’s will, and oversees trials of faith.

    - Current High Priestess: **Selaryne Valdoria** _(seh-LAR-een VAL-dor-ee-uh)_

1. **Council of Elders** – Senior advisors who administer religious law, education, and regional governance.

    - They are tasked with implementing the High Priestess’s directives and maintaining harmony.

1. **Bishops** – Each presides over a district or major temple, managing clergy and local military units.
1. **Clergy** – Priests and acolytes who maintain daily worship, teach doctrine, and assist in magical or healing duties.
1. **Acolytes and Novitiates** – Initiates of the faith who train under priests, often becoming clerics or holy warriors.

## Key Features

- Absolute unity; corruption is nonexistent.
- All citizens are expected to uphold the moral code, but enforcement is compassionate rather than punitive.
- Education, magical practice, and governance are intertwined with faith.

## The Goddess’ Trial

The Trial is a sacred rite that tests a person’s intentions, strength of character, and potential for corruption.
- **Access:** Only those chosen or permitted by the High Priestess may attempt it.
- **Mechanics:** The Trial transports the participant into a **pocket dungeon dimension**, fully isolated.
- **Objective:** Complete the trial alone; the Trial evaluates inner strength and moral alignment.

## Trial Types

1. **Trial of Will**

    - Tests the participant’s resolve.

    - Uses **past guilt, remorse, and regret** as illusions to sway them.

    - Success requires acceptance of past mistakes and steadfastness.

1. **Trial of the Heart**

    - Tests resistance to corruption.

    - Presents the participant with **temptations, desires, or promises of power**.

    - Success depends on prioritizing duty, compassion, and moral integrity over selfish gain.

1. **Trial of the Mind**

    - Confronts the participant’s darkest self.

    - A **dark duplicate** is created: it possesses the participant’s abilities, memories, and knowledge.

    - The duplicate exaggerates flaws, insecurities, and suppressed desires, attempting to persuade the participant to succumb to darkness.

    - Success requires confronting inner shadows without surrendering to them.

## Outcome

- Passing all three trials earns divine blessing, granting legitimacy, trust, and sometimes minor magical empowerment.
- Failure is rare but may result in a temporary spiritual void, loss of favor, or reassignment to further penance and training.
