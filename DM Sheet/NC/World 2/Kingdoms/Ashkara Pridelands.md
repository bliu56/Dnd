## Summary

Comprised of mixed race humanoids, this society was once marginalized and oppressed by the other kingdoms.
Their culture was tribal, merit based, and forged through strength. Leadership of all tribes belonged to the strongest and most worthy champion, chosen through trial and conquest.
During the war, the tribal warriors became indispensable. Their ferocity, adaptability, and willingness to fight demons where others could not turned the tide of multiple campaigns.
After the war, their sacrifices could no longer be ignored. The confederation emerged as an equal among nations, no longer tolerated but respected. Trade, diplomacy, and cultural exchange flourished, and their society entered an era of prosperity.
