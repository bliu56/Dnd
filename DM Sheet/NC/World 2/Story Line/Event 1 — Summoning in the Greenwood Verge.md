The party is suddenly summoned into a dense, ancient forest known locally as the **Greenwood Verge**, a place steeped in old magic and watched by unseen forces.
The air is heavy and unfamiliar. Light filters through towering trees older than most kingdoms. Before the party can fully orient themselves, a **panicked scream** cuts through the forest.
The scream is human. It is close.
