The party comes upon a small forest road where a **traveling merchant caravan** has been attacked.

## Scene Setup

- A merchant wagon lies partially overturned.
- Several crates are broken open.
- **Bandits**, coordinated and experienced, are directing **trained wolves** to harry the merchant.
- The merchant is wounded but still alive, desperately fending off attacks.
The bandits are not mindless criminals. They are organized, and the wolves respond to whistles and gestures.
This encounter is volatile and time-sensitive.

## Possible Outcomes

## Outcome A: Merchant Survives (Bandits Defeated or Driven Off)

## Immediate Result

- The merchant survives, shaken but grateful.
- Any surviving bandits flee into the forest.

## Narrative Consequences

- The merchant offers thanks, supplies, and information.
- He insists on repaying the party by guiding them.

## Follow-Up Travel Condition

- The merchant must first stop at a **nearby village** to tend wounds and secure goods.
- From there, he can arrange passage or directions to:

    - Kingdom of Aurelion

    - Sanctum of Solythea

    - Ashkara Pridelands

    - Information about the former Demon King’s castle

The village serves as an early social hub and soft introduction to the post-war world.

## Outcome B: Bandits Survive (Merchant Dies)

## Immediate Result

- The merchant is slain.
- One or more bandits survive, either surrendering or retreating.

## Narrative Consequences

- Surviving bandits assess the party cautiously.
- They are pragmatic, not fanatical.

## Follow-Up Travel Condition

- The bandits offer guidance, but only after returning to their **forest stronghold**.
- Their stronghold introduces:

    - Criminal politics

    - Lingering post-war instability

    - Rumors of demon relics and forbidden magic

Bandits can guide the party anywhere eventually, but at slower speed and with morally gray complications.

## Outcome C: Merchant and Bandits Both Survive

## Immediate Result

- The fight ends in a stalemate or forced separation.
- Both sides disengage.

## Narrative Consequences

- The party must choose whom to trust.
- Either can act as a guide, but not both.

## Follow-Up Travel Condition

- Choosing the merchant leads to the village route.
- Choosing the bandits leads to the stronghold route.
- The unchosen faction may resurface later, remembering the party’s decision.

## Outcome D: Merchant and Bandits All Die

This outcome triggers a **special, hidden encounter**.

## Special Event: Guardian of the Greenwood Verge

## The Giant Mystic Wolf Appears

As silence settles over the battlefield, the forest grows unnaturally still.
A low, resonant growl echoes through the trees.
From the shadows emerges a **giant mystic wolf**, its fur silver-gray and faintly luminous, eyes glowing with ancient intelligence. The forest itself seems to yield to its presence.
This being is a **Guardian of the Greenwood Verge**, a remnant of old pacts predating the kingdoms.

## Special Interaction: Mistaken Identity

The wolf’s gaze locks onto **Edward**.
It approaches calmly, respectfully.
It speaks.
Not aloud, but directly into the mind.

> “It has been some time, Hero. You look… different. Have the years of peace treated you well?”
The wolf assumes Edward is **the Hero of the Great War**.
Regardless of Edward’s response:
- The wolf listens politely.
- The wolf does not correct itself.
- The wolf is convinced.

> “Retirement suits you poorly, it seems. Tell me, where does your path lead now?”
Edward does not know:
- He is the younger brother of the true hero.
- The resemblance is not physical, but spiritual.
The guardian senses **lineage**, not memory.

## Guardian’s Aid

Once the party names a destination, the mystic wolf agrees to guide them.

## Travel Benefits

- The wolf and its unseen pack can move the party **anywhere within a single day**, regardless of distance.
- This includes:

    - Any of the three kingdoms

    - The ruins of the former Demon King’s castle
