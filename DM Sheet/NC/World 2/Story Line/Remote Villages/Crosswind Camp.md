## The Festival of the Unbowed Warrior

## Event Overview

A raucous week-long celebration combining combat exhibitions, feasting, storytelling, and ritual combat. Officially celebrates "the spirit of warriors who never yield," but secretly honors the Hero who fought alongside the camp during a desperate battle.

## The Camp's Secret

During the war, Crosswind Camp was surrounded by a massive demon force. Outnumbered five to one, the warriors prepared for their final stand. The Hero arrived with reinforcements and fought for three days straight without rest, rallying the defenders and turning certain death into legendary victory. The camp's survival became a source of pride. Honoring the Hero's wish for quiet, they celebrate "the warrior spirit" - embodied by him.

## When the Party Arrives

The camp is alive with activity: weapons being sharpened, combat rings prepared, cooking fires burning, and warriors testing their strength.
When Edward enters:
- Warriors stop mid-motion, weapons lowered in unconscious respect
- Kessa's eyes widen for just a moment before she schools her expression
- Rakka nods slowly, as if confirming something he already knew
- Gorak lets out a booming laugh that sounds like joy mixed with disbelief
- Young warriors whisper excitedly and jostle for position to get closer
- Veterans exchange knowing looks but say nothing

## The Treatment

- The party is offered a permanent stone structure usually reserved for chieftain visits
- Kessa insists Edward sit at the "warrior's seat" during the evening feast - the place of highest honor

- During sparring demonstrations, fighters dedicate their matches "to the spirit that guides us"
- Gorak offers to spar with Edward "for the honor," treating it like a sacred ritual
- Rakka performs a blessing ceremony, speaking of "spirits who walk the mortal path again"
- The best cut of meat at every meal is placed before Edward first
- Warriors seek Edward's opinion on techniques, treating his words like wisdom from the ancestors
_Toward the Rest of the Party:_
- Welcomed as warriors regardless of actual combat ability ("All who journey are warriors of the path")
- Offered food, drink, and challenges in friendly competition
- Asked about their skills: "What is your strength?" "How do you prove yourself?"
- Invited to participate in contests and celebrations
- Treated with respect and camaraderie
- Warriors comment: "You are strong to stand beside such strength" and "Your courage is clear in your choice of companion"
