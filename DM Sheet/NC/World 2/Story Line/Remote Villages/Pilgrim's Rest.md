## The Festival of Answered Prayers

## Event Overview

A solemn yet joyful three-day religious festival celebrating divine intervention and miraculous salvation. Officially commemorates "the day the Supreme God answered our prayers," but truly honors the Hero who saved the village.

## The Village's Secret

During the war, a demon cult attempted to corrupt Pilgrim's Rest and use it as a staging ground to attack the Sanctum itself. The Hero arrived during a dark ritual, drove out the cultists, and purified the temple grounds. The villagers prayed desperately that night, and the Hero was their answer. Following the Hero's request for anonymity, they frame the celebration as divine intervention - which, in their hearts, it was.

## When the Party Arrives

The village is adorned with white ribbons, prayer bells, and sacred candles. A peaceful reverence fills the air.
When Edward enters:
- Brother Aldric's hand trembles slightly as he greets them
- Matron Elara's eyes glisten with tears she quickly blinks away
- Villagers bow slightly - a gesture usually reserved for clergy
- Several villagers make subtle hand signs of blessing toward Edward
- Thom stares in open wonder before someone nudges him to look away

## The Treatment

_Toward Edward:_
- The party is offered rooms in the temple's pilgrim quarters - the most sacred lodging available
- Brother Aldric insists Edward take the "room of honored rest," explaining it's "tradition for the most weary traveler"
- Meals are brought to Edward first, portions slightly larger and more carefully prepared
- Villagers approach with small offerings: prayer beads, blessed water, sacred herbs - "gifts for protection on your journey"
- During prayers, Brother Aldric's words echo themes of "returned blessings" and "those who walk among us unseen"
- Matron Elara "happens" to prepare Edward's meals exactly to his taste, claiming "divine inspiration"
- Villagers find excuses to stand near Edward, as if proximity itself brings comfort
_Toward the Rest of the Party:_
- Welcomed warmly as "companions of a blessed traveler"
- Offered prayers and blessings for their safety
- Asked gentle questions: "How did you come to travel together?" "What guides your path?"
- Included in all ceremonies and given places of honor
- Treated with deep respect and genuine care
- Villagers express quiet admiration: "You must have good souls to walk beside such a person"

## Festival Events

### The Cleansing Ceremony (Morning)

Villagers gather at the temple to purify the grounds with blessed water and sacred chants.
- Edward is invited to light the first purification candle
- When he does, villagers quietly weep with joy
- Brother Aldric speaks of "the night darkness fled before a single light"
- The ceremony includes prayers for "protectors who ask nothing for themselves"

### The Procession of Gratitude (Afternoon)

Villagers walk a sacred path through the highlands, carrying offerings to an outdoor shrine.
- Edward is asked to walk at the front "to represent all travelers who find their way to us"
- At the shrine, villagers leave tokens: flowers, candles, written prayers
- Many prayers are variations of "thank you for sending him to us" and "bless those who shield the weak"
- The party is invited to leave their own offerings or prayers

### The Evening of Remembrance (Night)

A candlelight vigil in the temple where stories of "divine intervention" are shared.
- Stories describe "an answer to prayer arriving in the form of a stranger"
- One account speaks of "a warrior with gentle hands who restored what was broken"
- Villagers share testimonies of how their lives changed "that night"
- Brother Aldric leads a prayer of thanks, speaking directly toward Edward but phrasing it as a general blessing
- Soft hymns follow, with harmonies that seem to wrap around Edward specifically
- Party members are asked if they'd like to share their own stories of hope or gratitude

## Subtle Hints (Easy to Miss)

- The shrine has a carved symbol that resembles a sword technique Edward knows, but abstracted into a holy symbol
- Brother Aldric mentions that "our savior had kind eyes" while looking at Edward, then quickly looking away
- Children draw pictures of "the blessed warrior" that coincidentally resemble Edward's general build and bearing
- Thom, in his enthusiasm, nearly says something revealing but is quickly interrupted by an elder
- Matron Elara whispers "Thank you for coming back" when serving Edward, then quickly adds "to our village, I mean"

## What the Party Learns

The party comes away thinking:
- These are deeply faithful, peaceful people who've survived something traumatic
- The festival is a beautiful expression of sincere religious devotion
- The villagers are exceptionally kind to everyone, especially Edward - probably because he has a naturally calming presence
- They're genuinely grateful for their survival and see blessings everywhere
