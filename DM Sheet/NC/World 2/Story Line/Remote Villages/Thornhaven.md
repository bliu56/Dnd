## The Timber's Blessing Festival

## Event Overview

An annual three-day festival celebrating the village's survival and prosperity. Officially honors "the forest's blessing," but the true purpose is to secretly honor the Hero who saved the village during the war.

## The Village's Secret

During the Great War, a demon warband cornered fleeing refugees near what would become Thornhaven. The Hero arrived, fought through the night, and held the demons back long enough for the refugees to escape into the deep forest. Those refugees founded Thornhaven. The villagers were told never to acknowledge the Hero if he returned, so they created this "festival" as their way of honoring him in secret.

## When the Party Arrives

The village is decorated with wooden carvings, lanterns, and flower garlands. Villagers are preparing for the evening's main celebration.
When Edward enters:
- Conversations pause briefly, then resume with forced casualness
- Villagers steal glances but don't stare
- Children whisper excitedly until parents gently shush them
- Several villagers suddenly "remember" urgent tasks elsewhere, then return moments later trying to act natural

## The Treatment

_Toward Edward:_
- The party is offered the "guest lodge" - the nicest building in town, usually reserved for important merchants
- Garrick insists Edward take the head seat at communal meals, citing "you look tired from travel"
- Villagers bring small gifts: carved figures, preserved foods, a "lucky" timber charm - all presented as "festival tradition for travelers"
- During conversations, villagers frequently mention how grateful they are for "second chances" and "those who protect the helpless"
- Merra "accidentally" makes Edward's favorite tea without asking his preference, then acts surprised it's exactly right
- Finn offers to sharpen Edward's weapons "as thanks for listening to my stories," doing an exceptional job
_Toward the Rest of the Party:_
- Warm and welcoming, offering food and drink freely
- Genuine interest in their stories and backgrounds
- Asked respectful questions: "How did you all meet?" "What brings you together?"
- Given comfortable accommodations and included in all festivities
- Treated as honored guests, but with slightly less intensity than Edward
- Villagers express admiration: "You must be good people to travel with such a fine companion"

## Festival Events

### The Timber Raising Ceremony (Afternoon)

Villagers work together to raise a massive carved timber pole in the village center. The pole is inscribed with symbols of protection and gratitude.
- Edward is asked to help with the "honor position" on the main rope
- When it's raised, villagers cheer and several quietly wipe tears
- Garrick makes a speech about "remembering those who held the line when darkness came"

### The Story Circle (Evening)

Elder villagers share "old tales" around a great bonfire. The stories are thinly-veiled retellings of the night the Hero saved them.
- One story describes "a stranger with kind eyes who stood alone against the tide"
- Another mentions "the protector who asked nothing in return"
- Children act out the stories with wooden swords, always casting the "hero" as brave and selfless
- The party is invited to share their own stories; villagers listen with rapt attention

### The Gratitude Feast (Night)

A massive communal meal with everyone in the village.
- The first serving is placed before Edward before anyone else eats
- Toasts are made "to those who give us tomorrow" and "to strangers who become saviors"
- Quiet moments where villagers approach Edward, thank him for "visiting our humble village," with unusual emotion
- Music and dancing follow, with Edward repeatedly asked to dance ("it's tradition for honored guests")
- Party members are also invited to dance and celebrate, asked about their adventures

## Subtle Hints (Easy to Miss)

- The carved timber pole has a symbol that matches a technique Edward might use, but it's abstract enough to be coincidence
- Merra mentions she had "two brave sons once" and looks at Edward with profound sadness and gratitude
- Children's play-acting describes the hero's fighting stance with surprising accuracy to Edward's style
- A carved wooden figure gifted to Edward depicts a warrior in a pose similar to one Edward uses

## What the Party Learns

The party comes away thinking:
- These are incredibly kind, generous people who love celebrating life
- The festival is a beautiful tradition honoring survival and community
- The villagers seem especially fond of Edward, probably because he's naturally likeable
- They're deeply grateful people who haven't forgotten the war's cost

## Rumors & Information

- Merchants from Aurelion report increased noble house activity
- Strange lights seen in the deep forest at night
- The capital is preparing for a grand celebration
- Garrick quietly mentions travelers matching the party's description were "expected" - though he won't say why
