_(LY-san-dor KAYL)_

## General Description

- **Age:** Early 20s during the Great War
- **Appearance:** Lean and slightly wiry, with dark brown hair often tied back, and piercing gray eyes that reflect intelligence and suspicion. Wears simple robes with faintly enchanted trinkets he has crafted himself. Carries a staff carved with runes of concealment and magical focus.
- **Personality:**

    - **Curious & Observant:** Highly analytical, always noticing inconsistencies or hidden patterns.

    - **Skeptical & Conspiratorial:** Tends to distrust what he can’t fully understand; forms theories and often obsesses over possibilities others dismiss.

    - **Loyal to Knowledge:** Deep respect for Archmage Corvellan Rhys; places magical understanding above all else.

    - **Cold & Calculating:** Willing to take extreme measures if he believes it protects the greater good—or if he perceives a threat.

    - **Secretive:** Keeps his plans and investigations hidden from everyone except those he trusts implicitly.

## Training & Skills

- **Arcane Prodigy:** Rapidly mastered a wide variety of magical disciplines under Corvellan Rhys. Skilled in elemental, protective, and illusion magic.
- **Tactical Intelligence:** Excellent at predicting enemy movements, magical traps, and battlefield threats.
- **Research & Investigation:** Obsessed with uncovering hidden truths, ancient artifacts, and magical secrets.
- **Concealment & Preparation:** Learned stealthy magical techniques from Corvellan and his own research.

## Role in the War

- **Initial Alignment:** Fought alongside the hero and royal forces, using intelligence and magic to support campaigns.
- **Suspicion of the Hero:** Noticed anomalies in the hero’s power and formed theories of demonic influence. Became convinced that the hero could be a hidden threat.
- **Pact Formation:** Attempted to force the truth out, nearly sacrificing himself and confronting the hero directly. The hero, seeking to prevent bloodshed, convinced Lysandor to make a **magical pact**:

    - Hero would defeat the Demon King and leave afterward.

    - Lysandor would continue assisting the hero until the pact’s terms were fulfilled.

    - Breaking the pact by either party would result in death.

## Relationship to Others

- **Hero:** Complex; initially ally, then adversary in a crisis of belief, finally bound by a magical pact. Holds deep respect for the hero’s abilities but remains wary of hidden powers.
- **Archmage Corvellan Rhys:** Revered mentor; Lysandor embodies the principle of self-motivation instilled by Corvellan.
- **Royal Forces:** Respected as a powerful mage and strategist but largely kept at a distance due to his secretive nature.

## Abilities & Special Traits

- **Hidden Potential:** Inherited the hero’s latent demonic powers indirectly; has an acute understanding of dark magic.
- **Strategist & Planner:** Uses foresight, magical insight, and battlefield tactics to outthink opponents.
- **Pact-Bound Loyalty:** His actions are strictly governed by the magical contract with the hero. Breaking the pact is fatal.
- **Occult Knowledge:** Knows of forbidden rituals, secret magical relics, and the hidden history of demons.
