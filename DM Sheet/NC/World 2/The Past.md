## The Age of Desperation

For centuries, the demon race encroached upon the mortal world under the rule of the Demon King, whose armies threatened the extinction of all civilized peoples. Humanity stood fractured, divided into rival kingdoms and ideologies, unable to resist the demonic tide alone.
At the brink of annihilation, a higher power intervened. Through a forbidden summoning ritual sanctioned by divine authority, heroes were called forth from another world. These summoned heroes became symbols of hope and unity, rallying the fractured nations into a single coalition.
This act was not publicly framed as divine desperation, but rather as destiny fulfilled.

## The Great War Against the Demon King - The Three Kingdoms United

When the Demon King’s armies first crossed the outer borders, it was the Kingdom of Aurelion that stood nearest to the storm.
The summoned hero arrived at the royal court bearing proof of the higher power’s mandate. King Altharion of Aurelion gave his support without hesitation, recognizing that divided crowns would doom all realms. The Royal Faction rallied behind the hero, opening the kingdom’s armies, vaults, and roads to the coming war.
The Noble Faction, however, resisted.
Many aristocrats viewed the hero as an outsider and the war as an opportunity rather than a threat. Some argued for isolation, others for appeasement. A few, already whispering with darker powers, openly challenged the king’s authority. Without noble levies and resources, Aurelion’s strength was fractured.
Seeing that words would not sway them, the hero left the court.
The journey led south to the Ashkara Pridelands, where strength alone determined worth. There, the hero faced the High Chieftain of the Ashkara Conclave. Rather than plead, the hero fought alongside the tribes against a demon incursion that had already breached their lands. Blood was spilled, bonds were forged, and through trial and battle the hero proved worthy.
The High Chieftain knelt not in submission, but in recognition. The Ashkara Conclave pledged their warriors to the coming war.
From the Pridelands, the hero traveled to the Sanctum of Solythea.
Within the sacred halls, the High Priestess tested not the hero’s strength, but his intent. Through ritual, vision, and divine scrutiny, she weighed his soul before the Supreme God. When the rites were complete, the High Priestess proclaimed that the hero’s cause aligned with Solythea’s will and bestowed a public blessing upon him.
This blessing carried immense weight.
News of the Ashkara’s pledge and Solythea’s favor spread quickly. The Noble Faction of Aurelion found themselves isolated. To oppose the hero now was to stand against both divine will and proven strength.
One by one, the nobles relented. Some out of conviction, others out of fear, and a few with hidden resentment.
Thus, the Three Kingdoms were united.
Not by treaty alone, but by trial, faith, and the undeniable truth that none would survive the Demon King alone.
From that moment, the war ceased to be a series of desperate defenses. It became a crusade.

## The Summoned Hero and the Mage

Among the summoned heroes was one who would lead the final charge against the Demon King. Unknown to all others, this hero carried dormant demonic power inherited from his father, a secret he never shared.
A human mage traveled alongside the hero throughout the war. Intelligent and observant, the mage began noticing subtle inconsistencies surrounding the hero. Small details, improbable survivals, and moments of unnatural strength planted seeds of suspicion.
At first, these doubts were dismissed even by the mage himself.
Everything changed during a battle against a demon general. The hero, on the brink of death, unconsciously awakened his sealed demonic power and annihilated the general in a display that defied mortal magic.
The mage was the sole witness.
From that moment, the mage became convinced the hero was a demon in disguise. He attempted to warn the rest of the party, but they dismissed his claims as paranoia born of exhaustion and fear. The hero’s reputation and consistent compassion outweighed a single mage’s testimony.
Unable to abandon his conviction, the mage resolved to uncover the truth alone.

## The Broken Alliance

The mage secretly prepared a trap that would isolate the hero. His intent was absolute. If the hero was a demon, the mage would sacrifice his own life to destroy him.
When the trap was sprung, the mage attacked without hesitation.
The hero refused to fight back, denying the accusation and insisting on his loyalty to humanity. The mage pressed the assault relentlessly, forcing the hero into desperation.
Cornered and left with no alternative, the hero used some unknown power to escape.
This act neither confirmed nor denied his fears.
The mage began casting a self sacrificial spell designed to annihilate both of them. The hero overpowered him at the final moment, forcibly interrupting the spell.
What followed was not a battle, but a confession.
The hero told a half-truth about his power but swore his allegiance to humanity and his intent to destroy the Demon King. To prove this, he proposed a magical contract.
The pact was absolute. The hero would defeat the Demon King and then leave the world forever peacefully. The mage would continue aiding the hero until the war’s end. If either broke the contract, death would follow.
Bound by magic and conviction, the mage accepted.

## The Fall of the Demon King

The war reached its conclusion. With the summoned heroes at the forefront, the Demon King was slain, and his armies scattered.
True to the contract, the hero departed this world, returning to the realm from which he was summoned. His existence, origin, and final fate became a carefully curated legend.
The mage kept the hero’s secret. Outwardly, he was remembered as a loyal ally and war hero.
Inwardly, the mage never abandoned his fear.

## The Hidden Preparations

Believing vigilance was humanity’s only safeguard, the mage began preparing for a future where the hero might return as a new Demon King.
To prevent such a catastrophe, the mage secretly claimed the Demon King’s sword, a relic saturated with abyssal power. He sealed it within a private pocket dimension known only to himself.
There, the mage began long term contingency planning. Research, countermeasures, and forbidden magic were pursued quietly, all in the name of protecting the world from a threat that might never come.

## The Official Lie

The rulers of all three kingdoms agreed on a single deception.
The truth of the heroes’ otherworldly origin was suppressed. The people were told that the great hero had chosen to retire in peace after the war.
Citizens were instructed that if they ever encountered the hero again, they should pretend not to recognize him. This was framed as a final honor, a way to grant the savior the quiet life he deserved.
In reality, this lie ensured the world would never grow dependent on foreign champions again.

## The World at Rest

The Demon King was dead. The kingdoms stood united, scarred but stronger. Faith, monarchy, and tribal strength found a fragile equilibrium.
Yet beneath the peace lay secrets, sealed weapons, binding contracts, and the unanswered question of whether the hero’s power was truly gone from the world forever.
This is the world as it stands when the players arrive.
