There was a holy inquisition sent and they located the area it could be. The Church’s strongest went to lead it.

Eventually, they found the former Hero and Kid together. After a long fight, they bested the Hero and while the Hero used the last of his energy to teleport the Kid to safety. Arthur died and the Kid through his grief awaken his powers which resulted in the Forest turning into another color.
