## New Home?
### **The Indoctrination Begins**
From the moment new children arrive, Seris focuses on the emotional wounds they carry. She speaks to each child individually, learning exactly what they fear and what they long for. Then she fills that void perfectly. For the lonely, she gives attention. For the ashamed, she gives forgiveness. For the angry, she gives patient understanding. The more the child depends on her, the more she subtly directs their moral compass toward obedience and loyalty above all else.
Small rules reinforce this dependence. Children must thank her for every meal, every lesson, every comfort. Praise is abundant, but it is always tied to pleasing her. Disappointment, though soft, feels world-ending because it comes from the only adult who has ever made them feel wanted. The orphan quickly learns that Seris’s approval is the most precious currency in the house.

### **Age-Tier Roles That Seem Harmless**
Seris has created a tiered system within the orphanage that appears designed to give children responsibility and confidence. Each tier has special privileges. In truth, each tier also prepares them for small acts of service that support her criminal network.
Young children are called **Seedlings**. Their tasks are simple: run to nearby shops with notes, deliver cookies to neighbors, or fetch items. Seris tells them this helps the community trust them. The tasks seem innocent and even empowering.
Older children become **Tenders**. They escort younger kids, run errands alone, and help with administrative chores. They occasionally pass along sealed envelopes or packages to “generous benefactors” or “church members,” though the children are told these are donations or thank-you gifts.
The oldest children are **Stewards**, praised as the pillars of the home. They are trusted with more personal tasks: listening to neighborhood gossip while doing chores in the market, memorizing names and routines of nearby officials, or befriending certain well-targeted adults. Everything is framed as service and goodwill. The kids don’t realize they’ve been taught to gather intelligence, build connections, and be the perfect tools.

### **The First Hints of the Truth (But Not the Reveal Yet)**
The players will notice subtle oddities even before the reveal.
At night, Seris often has visitors who enter through the back door. They’re always well-dressed, always polite, and always treat Seris with a kind of reverence that feels strange. The children assume they are donors. They are told never to disturb these meetings.
Once in a while, a child is suddenly adopted into an influential family. It feels like a miracle every time. Seris celebrates it joyfully, but she always takes the child aside for a long private conversation beforehand. The adopted child leaves looking proud, honored even, but also weighed down by seriousness. They write occasionally, but their letters feel rehearsed.
The orphan occasionally overhears Seris discussing them with her guests: comments like “He shows promise,” or “He’ll make a loyal one,” or “He already understands gratitude.” These seem benign on the surface but create a creeping sense of being evaluated for something.

### **The Illusion of Safety**
Despite the hidden machinations, life at Golden Vale is genuinely comforting. The children are fed, clothed, educated, and protected. Bullies are handled. Fears are soothed. Seris intervenes when a child is hurt or scared. She never allows violence within the walls. This makes the children fiercely loyal to her, because she truly _did_ save them from worse conditions.
The city loves the orphanage. Police, merchants, clergy, and even politicians praise it. The children become locally known for being polite, helpful, and spotless in reputation. They can go nearly anywhere without suspicion.
To the world, the orphanage is a place of hope.
To Seris, it is a garden where she grows dependable assets.
To the children, it feels like the only real home they’ve ever known.

### **Stage Setting for Future Conflict**
This environment sets up several future story beats:
1. **A rival orphan begins questioning Seris, creating tension.**
    
    Their doubt spreads unease but is dismissed as childish rebellion.
    
1. **The orphan (your player) is assigned a small, seemingly innocent task that serves the organization.**
    
    Something like delivering a note to a local shopkeeper, unaware it is coded instructions.
    
1. **A police officer or investigator begins sniffing around the orphanage.**
    
    Seris maintains grace, but the children sense tension. She quietly tells the kids to avoid talking to officials.
    
1. **A potential adoptive family expresses interest in the player.**
    
    Seris seems delighted, but her private conversation afterward feels heavy with unspoken expectations.
    
1. **A mysterious older child returns to visit.**
    
    They act strangely loyal and almost reverent toward Seris, praising the “mission” of the home.
    
All of this builds to an eventual reveal, but up until that point, the players believe they are living in a warm, loving sanctuary with the perfect caretaker. The criminal machinery underneath remains hidden but always present.
## The House of the Golden Vale
The orphan is taken in by a woman known as **Mother Seris Vale**, the founder of a private orphanage called the **House of the Golden Vale**. To the public, the home is famous for its warmth and miraculous ability to reform troubled or abandoned children. Seris is gentle, soft-spoken, and always wears a white shawl reminiscent of a nun's habit. She never raises her voice. She always refers to the children as her little lambs. Her smiles are calm and endlessly forgiving, which makes her incredibly disarming.
The building itself sits slightly outside the main residential districts, in a peaceful, older part of the city. The front garden is immaculately maintained, always filled with fresh flowers that the children are asked to water daily. Inside, everything is clean, modest, and warm. The older children help the younger ones, and the daily structure gives an illusion of order and safety. There are morning routines, chores, learning periods, and communal dinners where Seris tells small moral stories about kindness, gratitude, and loyalty.
