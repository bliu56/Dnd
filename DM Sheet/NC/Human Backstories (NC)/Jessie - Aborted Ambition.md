## Another start?
## Scenario 2: The Coach’s First Offer (Para Team)
**Setting:**
Locker room hallway, or a quiet corner of the gym after the clinic. The smell of sweat and disinfectant. Familiar. Uncomfortable.
**Event:**
The old coach, or a respected coach who knew her reputation, approaches. Calm. Direct. No pity.
**Offer One:**
He explains that a parafencing team is forming or restructuring. Funding is unstable but real. Tryouts are soon. He believes she has the tactical mind and competitive fire to qualify.
**Key points:**
- This is not framed as “settling.” He’s clear: parafencing is brutal, fast, and political.
- He warns her that she will be measured differently. Watched differently.
- Travel. Training. Media. Her life would narrow around the sport again.
**Emotional pressure:**
This is a chance to reclaim the identity of “athlete” without erasing her disability. But it means being seen, publicly, as someone who had to change.

## Scenario 3: The Coach’s Second Offer (Mentor)
**Setting:**
Same conversation, but after a pause. The coach hesitates before continuing.
**Offer Two:**
If she doesn’t want to compete, he wants her mind. He offers a part-time coaching role. Training youth fencers. Especially beginners and underfunded kids.
He specifically mentions the fan by name.
**Key points:**
- She would shape technique, strategy, discipline.
- No spotlight. No podiums.
- She becomes someone else’s foundation instead of her own comeback story.
**Emotional pressure:**
This option gives her impact without pain. Legacy without risk. But it quietly closes the door on being the one on the strip again.
**Conflict:**
The coach makes it clear she can’t do both seriously. The para team demands full commitment. Coaching demands consistency.
He gives her time to think.

## Scenario 4: The Rival and the Third Path
**Timing:**
Weeks later. After she’s started leaning toward one option. Maybe she’s already helped coach once. Or started para training. Either way, she’s moved forward.
**Setting:**
A coffee shop near campus, or a medical building. Neutral ground.
**Event:**
A former rival approaches. Someone she fenced against repeatedly. Someone who beat her once when it mattered. Someone who lost to her more often.
They don’t open with small talk.
**Reveal:**
The rival talks about a private treatment. Experimental. Overseas clinics. Months of rehab. No guarantees.
But there’s footage. A name. A doctor. Someone who used to compete and now walks.
**The cost:**
- Enormous money. Loans. Sponsorships. Debt.
- Time. A year or more.
- If she takes this path, she can’t coach. Not physically, not emotionally.
- If it fails, she loses momentum, reputation, and trust from the coach.
**Emotional twist:**
The rival isn’t offering kindness. They admit it outright:
“I don’t want to remember you as the one who disappeared.”
They leave a card. No pressure. But the door is now open.
## Scenario 1: The Fan
**Setting:**
A small college gym hosting a regional fencing clinic or exhibition. Nothing glamorous. Folding chairs. Old banners. The kind of place where the past feels louder than the present.
**Event:**
The player is only there because a professor offered extra credit, or because a friend dragged her along. She is not advertised as a guest. Most people don’t recognize her at first.
A teenage girl, maybe 14–16, approaches hesitantly. She uses the player’s full name, perfectly pronounced. She’s wearing cheap gear, taped gloves, and a jacket with a patch sewn on crooked.
**Dialogue beats:**
- The fan tells her she started fencing after watching old match footage online. Not highlights. Full matches. She talks about footwork patterns the player hasn’t thought about in years.
- She mentions that her parents don’t really get the sport, but the player made it “look like thinking mattered more than strength.”
- She asks a simple question: “Do you miss it?”
**Emotional hook:**
The fan isn’t starstruck. She’s grateful. She doesn’t see the disability first. She sees a lineage.
**Outcome:**
Before leaving, the fan asks if the player is ever going to fence again. Not professionally. Just… at all.
No answer feels right.
