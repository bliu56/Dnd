## Blessed?
## Event 2: The High-Up’s Son Tests Boundaries
As the bodyguard and tutor, the player spends a lot of time with the higher-up’s son, who is clever, spoiled, and curious. One day, the son demands that the player help him sneak out to vandalize a rival gang’s property. Normally, refusing would look suspicious. But the curse manifests as a sudden, involuntary refusal. The words come out of the player’s mouth before they even think about it.
This shocks the son, who is used to getting his way. He complains to his father, making the organization question the player’s reliability. The player realizes something is overriding their free will.

## Event 3: Forced Good Deed in Public
While traveling through the city, the player witnesses a stranger being harassed or robbed. Normally they would ignore it, staying low-profile. Instead, the curse activates in a more forceful way. The player’s legs move on their own. Their voice shouts before they intend to. They intervene publicly, drawing dangerous attention. Either they save the victim or cause chaos, but the outcome is unavoidable because the curse seizes control.
Later, someone from the organization confronts them privately, confused or angry that they acted like a vigilante.

## Event 4: The Lie That Won’t Leave Their Mouth
The organization asks the player to give a false report about an encounter. The lie is minor, but important. When they try to speak the lie, nothing comes out. Their throat constricts. Their voice breaks. If they keep pushing, the curse punishes them with an intense migraine or even knocks them unconscious.
This is when they first suspect the rules affecting their behavior are supernatural.
---
## Event 5: The Son in Danger
While escorting the higher-up’s son home, they are ambushed by a rival group. The “right” thing to do is clear: protect the boy. But the curse amplifies this to an extreme. Even if the ambush is a trap set by the organization to test loyalty, the curse makes the player throw themselves between the attackers and the boy without hesitation.
They may succeed in protecting him, but their actions are excessively self-sacrificial. Anyone watching is shocked at the sudden noble behavior.
This event could create tension. Some members admire it. Others are suspicious.
---
## Event 6: The Curse Interferes With a Violent Order
The higher-up gives the player a direct command: harm or extract information from someone who offended the organization. The moment the player raises their hand to strike, the curse paralyzes part of their body. If they force it, the curse sends a wave of searing pain through their arm, stopping them cold.
This is the first moment the player can no longer hide what is happening. Someone sees the hesitation, the wince, the pain. Rumors begin circulating that the player is losing their edge or turning soft.

## Event 7: Dreams From the Goddess
The player begins having vivid dreams each night. A woman made of light, or a voice echoing from a distant temple, reminds them of “the vow engraved upon the soul.” These dreams mix elements of the fantasy world and reality, confusing the player. Some dreams show flashbacks from the moment they were cursed in the fantasy world, but distorted, like a memory crossing dimensions.
This is the narrative link that pushes them toward investigating how their two lives are connected.
---
## Event 8: Life or Death Choice
In a tense confrontation, perhaps during an escalating gang conflict, the player is given a gun and ordered to kill someone. The curse responds violently. Their vision flickers white; their hand seizes; the gun falls from their grasp. A shock of magical force knocks them backward. It’s dramatic enough for everyone present to see something supernatural happened, even if they don’t understand it.
This moment forces the player to realize the curse is altering their fate.
---
## Event 9: The Organization Becomes Suspicious
Higher-ups begin quietly monitoring the player. They assign someone to shadow them, checking whether their moral behavior is intentional or a sign of betrayal. The shadow might become a recurring NPC who confronts the player, tries to trap them, or even attempts to force them into morally compromising situations.
The curse will activate every time, making things worse.
---
## Event 10: The Breaking Point
Eventually, the organization plans a decisive test. They force the player into a scenario where following the curse will expose them as disobedient. Disobeying the curse, however, is impossible. When the curse reacts, it manifests in a stronger, more supernatural way: glowing eyes, a burst of warmth, a shockwave of divine force, or a sudden healing of someone wounded.
This is the climax that makes it undeniable: the real world is being shaped by something divine, and the player must find the root of it.
## Event 1: The Debt Collector Test
### Original
The criminal organization sends a pair of collectors to check on the player’s loyalty and obedience. Their job is simple: intimidate a local shop owner who missed a payment. The player is supposed to supervise the collectors and make sure the message is delivered. However, the curse prevents them from allowing harm to an innocent person. When the collectors start roughing up the shop owner, the player feels a sudden, constricting force in their chest, an overwhelming sense of dread, and their muscles physically lock. They can’t take part in the intimidation. If they try to push through it, the curse causes visible symptoms like trembling hands, blurry vision, or even a painful ringing in their ears.
This is the first sign that something is wrong, and the criminal organization notices their hesitation.
