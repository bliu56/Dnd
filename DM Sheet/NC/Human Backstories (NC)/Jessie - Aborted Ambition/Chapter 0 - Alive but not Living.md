Aborted Ambition awoke in her small dorm room as the first light of dawn crept through the window. She lay there for a moment, the silence only broken by the faint hum of the campus outside. Slowly, she pushed herself up, her movements deliberate and careful, a constant reminder of the limitations imposed by her condition.
Her morning routine was simple but demanding, requiring her to navigate tasks that once seemed effortless. After dressing, she made her way to the dining hall, where she picked at her breakfast, more out of routine than hunger. Around her, other students chatted and laughed, their conversations a blur, as she sat in solitude.
As the day progressed, Aborted Ambition attended her classes. [What is your least liked subject in school]. Though she was present, her mind often wandered, the subjects failing to ignite the passion she once felt for fencing. Without a declared major, she drifted through the curriculum, unsure of her place in this new chapter of her life.
Her afternoons were no different. With no club meetings or practice sessions to fill her time, she aimlessly explored the campus. She found herself at the gymnasium, the echoes of clashing swords haunting her as she watched the energetic athletes practice. Memories of her fencing days flooded back, bittersweet and painful.
Facing the gym's entrance, Aborted Ambition considered her options:
1. **Enter the gym and try to practice fencing again.**
    
    - As she picks up a foil, her hand shakes uncontrollably. The students around her cast pitiful glances, and she drops the weapon, unable to reclaim her former grace. Humiliated, she retreats, the reminder of her lost skill sharper than ever.
    
1. **Turn away and head to the library to lose herself in books.**
    
    - In the quiet hush of the library, she selects a book but finds the words elusive. Her mind drifts back to the gym, and the escapism she sought slips through her fingers, leaving her more isolated and unfulfilled.
    
1. **Approach the coach and ask for guidance.**
    
    - The coach, sympathetic but realistic, explains that focusing on academics might be more beneficial for her now, unintentionally driving a wedge deeper into her lingering dreams of fencing prowess.
    
Refusing to join any support groups, she avoided interactions that reminded her of her new reality. The pride that once fueled her ambitions now isolated her, leaving her to navigate the college experience alone.
As evening descended, Aborted Ambition returned to her dorm. She spent the night with a book in hand, the words offering temporary escape. Yet, when the lights were out and silence enveloped her room once more, she couldn’t escape the weight of her lost dreams.
She drifted to sleep, her mind restless, caught between the shadows of her past and the uncertainty of her future.
