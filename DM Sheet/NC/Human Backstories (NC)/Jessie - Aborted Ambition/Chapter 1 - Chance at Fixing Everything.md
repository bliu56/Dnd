As he expertly maneuvered the wheelchair, they fell into conversation. The man asked about her life, his questions surprisingly insightful. Aborted Ambition, initially guarded, found herself opening up, sharing fragments of her past: the dreams that once fueled her, the ambitions aborted by circumstance.
"What would you do if you were all better?" he inquired, his tone genuinely curious.
~~She paused, the question hovering in the air, a ghost of possibilities. She imagined herself back on the fencing strip, foil in hand, the thrill of competition coursing through her veins. She envisioned a life where her condition no longer dictated her every move, where her dreams were no longer lost to time.~~

With his words echoing in her mind, Aborted Ambition faced the rest of her day with a renewed sense of possibility, her path uncertain but no longer entirely alone.
