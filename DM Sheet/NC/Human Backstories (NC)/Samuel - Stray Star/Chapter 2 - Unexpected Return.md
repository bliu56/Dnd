Stray Star returned to the orphanage, her mind heavy with the disappointment of an unfulfilled mission. The world she had ventured into had been unforgiving, leaving her empty-handed and disheartened. Her steps were sluggish as she navigated the familiar corridors, the echoes of her failure lingering in her thoughts.
As she turned a corner, distracted by her own musings, she stumbled and fell, scraping her knee against the rough stone floor. Pain shot through her leg, bringing her back to the present. She winced, attempting to assess the damage, but her mind kept drifting back to the world she had tried and failed to conquer.
Seeking solace and assistance, Stray Star hobbled her way to Melissa, the gentle healer of the orphanage. Melissa's room was filled with the soothing aroma of herbs, a sanctuary within the bustling home. She looked up from her work as Stray Star entered, concern immediately etching her features.
"Oh, Stray Star," Melissa murmured, her voice soft and comforting. "What happened?"
Stray Star recounted her fall, leaving out the details of her mission, and sat down as Melissa gathered her supplies. With practiced hands, Melissa cleaned and bandaged the wound, her touch gentle and reassuring.
"You've always been so adventurous," Melissa remarked, a hint of admiration in her voice. "But remember, it's okay to ask for help when you need it."
Stray Star nodded, grateful for the reminder and the comfort of a friend. As Melissa finished her work, the two shared a moment of quiet companionship, the aches and bruises of their lives momentarily forgotten.
