Stray Star awoke to the dim morning light filtering through the cracked window of her shared room at the orphanage. She lay on her thin mattress for a moment, listening to the muffled sounds of the city outside and the quiet breathing of the other children. It was another day in the orphanage run by Director Richard, where routine was the only certainty.
Stray Star rose quietly, careful not to disturb her friends, her footsteps soft on the wooden floor. The air was chilly, a reminder of the draft that crept in through the old walls. She dressed quickly, pulling on a worn dress and shoes that had seen better days. Her morning began with a simple task: assisting in tidying up the common areas of the orphanage before breakfast.
Director Richard appeared in the dining hall, a smile plastered on his face as he greeted the children. The breakfast was a familiar sight—stale bread and lukewarm porridge. Stray Star ate quietly, exchanging glances and small smiles with her friends who sat nearby. Despite the meager meal, their company made the mornings bearable.
After breakfast, the children were instructed to head outside. Today, Stray Star joined her friends in the courtyard, where they were expected to play and appear cheerful for passersby. It was a façade, a performance for the sake of donations. She and her friends had grown accustomed to it, finding ways to make the best of the situation by creating games out of their duties.

In the afternoon, Stray Star helped with chores around the orphanage, cleaning and organizing under the watchful eye of Director Richard. The work was tedious, but it kept her mind occupied. Occasionally, she caught sight of the director sneaking into his office with a smug look, likely counting the day's donations.
As the sun dipped below the horizon, dinner was served—boiled potatoes that lacked flavor but filled their stomachs.
As the evening settled in, Stray Star and her friends huddled in a secluded corner of the common room. The air was filled with the warmth of shared stories and laughter, their collective imagination painting vivid escapes from the drab reality of orphanage life.
Suddenly, the group was interrupted by a soft rustling sound. Stray Star turned to see a small, injured bird that had somehow found its way into their sanctuary.

As the night deepened, Stray Star drifted to sleep with thoughts of the tiny bird and the world beyond the orphanage walls, filled with possibilities and freedom.
Night fell, and Stray Star returned to her bed. She listened to the hushed conversations and soft lullabies that filled the room, a comforting end to each day. As she drifted into sleep, she dreamed of a world beyond the orphanage's walls—a world where happiness wasn't a performance, and meals were shared in abundance.
