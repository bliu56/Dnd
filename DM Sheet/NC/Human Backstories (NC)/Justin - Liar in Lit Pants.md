## Staying Hidden
### Why They Cannot Leave
Mags suffered a minor stroke three months ago. She is stable, but her mobility is declining and she needs regular assistance.
She relies on the player for:
• Grocery shopping
• Picking up prescriptions
• Repairs around the apartment
• Running interference with aggressive landlords and shady neighbors
If the player leaves, Mags will likely be forced into an overburdened assisted living system.
The player knows this. Deep down, they feel responsible.
Even if they pretend otherwise, abandoning her is emotionally impossible.
### Escalation Hooks
- Mags starts getting threatening letters from someone in the criminal organization.
• A low-level enforcer questions her about the player’s whereabouts.
• Mags reveals she once dealt with this organization long ago as a social worker and knows more than she lets on.
• She gives the player guidance, warnings, and real-world moral grounding.
• Her health worsens if the player ignores her for too long.
• She discovers the wallet and confronts the player about it.
This NPC acts as emotional anchor, consequence engine, and conscience.

# NUMBER 3: The Detective
### **NPC: Detective Elias Marrow**
Age: mid-40s
Division: Organized Crime Task Force
Personality: Focused, principled, but morally flexible when the ends justify the means.
Appearance: Perpetually tired. Wears cheap suits with expensive shoes.
### How He Catches the Player
After the theft, the criminal organization erupts internally.
Marrow has been tracking them for years and recognizes the sudden instability as an opportunity.
The player makes one sloppy mistake:
• A camera catches their face near the scene.
• They use a known alias at a hotel.
• A paid informant identifies them.
Marrow quietly arrests them before the organization can. No paperwork, no public booking.
The player wakes up handcuffed to a chair in a private interrogation room.
### The Deal
Marrow offers the only thing the player wants more than freedom: survival.
He lays it out plainly:
“You stole from a man whose enemies fear him. They want you alive. His hunters want you dead. I’m your only exit.”
Marrow proposes:
• Full immunity for past financial crimes
• Protection from the organization’s retaliation
• A clean identity after the operation
• Dropping any current charges and blocking future prosecution
In exchange:
• The player infiltrates the organization at a low level
• They report any movements, names, and operations Marrow cannot get close to
• They help Marrow expose a larger conspiracy involving multiple officials
### Why They Cannot Leave the City
The deal is valid only within the city’s jurisdiction.
The moment the player leaves the city:
• Marrow loses legal authority
• Immunity becomes void
• Outstanding warrants reactivate
• The organization can abduct them without interference
Marrow makes it clear:
“If you run, I will not chase you. But the organization will. And they will find you first.”
### Escalation Hooks
- Marrow uses the player for increasingly dangerous errands.
• He pressures them using Mags’s safety without directly threatening her.
• The player discovers Marrow is hiding details about the organization’s true scale.
• Marrow’s partner dislikes using criminals and investigates the player independently.
• The organization tests the player’s loyalty, forcing moral dilemma.
• Marrow begins suspecting the player knows more than they admit about the wallet.
Marrow becomes a parallel authority figure, as controlling in his way as the criminal organization.
## 1. The City Is the Only Safe Territory
### Original
The criminal organization controls the region outside the city more tightly than the city itself.
Inside the city, law enforcement, rival syndicates, political oversight, and surveillance make open retaliation difficult.
Leaving the city puts the character into unregulated territory where the organization can snatch or kill them quietly.
Staying in the city is the only way to remain semi-protected.
**Why they stay:**
If they attempt to leave, they will likely be intercepted at bus terminals, train stations, or on highways.
Their safest option is staying somewhere densely populated where violence will attract attention.
**Storyline hooks:**
The player notices new faces watching their building.
They hear rumors about “accidents” happening just outside city limits.
An NPC contact warns them that a bounty hunter is waiting on the state border.
Justin decided to not leave
## 2: The Elderly Family Friend
### **NPC: Margaret “Mags” Holbrook**
Age: early 70s
Residence: run-down second floor apartment in the same city
Background: Former social worker. Tough, sharp-eyed, and refuses to be intimidated.
### Relationship to the Player
Mags was the closest thing the character ever had to a stable parent figure.
When the character was young:
• Mags lived next door.
• She fed them when their parents were unavailable or unreliable.
• She taught them how to read people and situations, ironically giving them the instincts they use in their cons.
• She bailed them out repeatedly, calling in favors from old contacts and even pawning sentimental belongings to cover the player’s mistakes.
To this day, she is the one person who sees through the character’s lies.
She does not judge them, but she is disappointed by wasted potential.
