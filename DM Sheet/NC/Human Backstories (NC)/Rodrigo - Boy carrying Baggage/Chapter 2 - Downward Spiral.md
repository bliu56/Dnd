Today when BCB woke up, his dad was making breakfast for them. This is unusual.
Unknown to BCB, his dad was laid off but the father didn't want to worry BCB so he said that he took the day off today.
At school, it will be a peaceful day since Damian will be out for family reasons. The two lackeys (Justin and Paul) will try to bully BCB but will suck at it.
