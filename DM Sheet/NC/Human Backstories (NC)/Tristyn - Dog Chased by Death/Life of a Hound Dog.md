The cityscape was cloaked in the grey mist of early morning as Dog Chased by Death stirred from his restless sleep. The faint smell of damp concrete and distant car horns filtered through the thin walls of his rundown apartment. He could hear the soft, almost apologetic creak of the floorboards beneath his feet as he rose, each step a reminder of the countless missions he had survived.
His morning routine was a stark contrast to the comfort enjoyed by those ignorant of the underworld's shadows. A quick, cold shower to wash away the grime from yesterday's work, a meager breakfast, and then the ritual cleaning of his tools – a battered knife, a silenced pistol, and a tattered notebook filled with sordid details. Each item told a story of survival, of violence, of a life lived on borrowed time.
Dog Chased by Death's phone buzzed, its screen lighting up with a message from the crime lord’s right-hand man, a curt reminder of the day's assignment. Another job, another debt to chip away at. Today, it was a collection run in a part of town that even the sun seemed to avoid. The faces there were familiar, the desperate and the downtrodden, each one a reflection of what he could have been, or perhaps what he still was.
As he navigated through the labyrinthine alleys, the weight of his existence pressed down on him. Every glance, every quickened heartbeat of those he encountered told him they knew who he was – the boss's chosen enforcer. He collected the money with a dispassionate efficiency, his presence alone enough to ensure compliance.
By midday, the sun was struggling to pierce through the thick smog, and Dog Chased by Death found himself at the boss's opulent headquarters. The contrast was jarring: marble floors, lush carpets, and an air thick with the scent of power. The crime lord greeted him with a predatory smile, a pat on the back that felt more like the touch of death itself.
"Good work, Dog," the crime lord purred, the nickname a twisted endearment.
Dog Chased by Death nodded, knowing better than to speak unless spoken to. He handed over the collections, each bundle of cash a step closer to a freedom that felt perpetually out of reach.
The afternoon brought another task – a message to be delivered not with words, but with fists. The target was a small-time dealer who had dared to cross the boss.

> [!important]

> 
> **Choice B: Physical Violence**
> 
> - **Action:** Dog Chased by Death proceeds to beat the dealer severely, ensuring every punch and kick conveys the message.
> 
> - **Result:** The dealer is left bloodied and bruised, clearly understanding the severity of his mistake. The boss is satisfied with the display of force, bolstering Dog's reputation as an enforcer, but it leaves Dog with fresh bruises and the dealer potentially seeking revenge in the future.
> 
> **Choice C: Destruction of Property**
> 
> - **Action:** Dog Chased by Death destroys the dealer's most prized possessions in front of him, smashing furniture, electronics, and any valuable items.
> 
> - **Result:** The dealer is devastated by the loss and the message is clear without physical harm. However, the dealer might still harbor thoughts of retribution, and the boss may see this as less effective than direct violence.
> 
> **Choice D: Psychological Tactics**
> 
> - **Action:** Dog Chased by Death subtly implies that the dealer's family or loved ones might be at risk if he crosses the boss again, leaving the dealer to imagine the horrors that could ensue.
> 
> - **Result:** The dealer is mentally tormented, living in constant fear for his loved ones. This method leaves no physical evidence, making it hard for the dealer to complain, but it places a heavy psychological burden on Dog as well.
  
By the time he was done, the dealer's whimpers echoing in the dimly lit room. He left without looking back, each step heavy with the knowledge of his role in this brutal world.
As the night descended, he returned to his apartment, the city’s neon lights casting eerie shadows on the walls. The exhaustion was bone-deep, but he still took time to clean his tools, the ritual offering a semblance of control in a life dictated by others.
Before he collapsed into bed, Dog Chased by Death allowed himself a moment of hope. One day, he thought, one day I will be free. But until that day came, he would remain the hound, forever chased by death, yet always surviving.
