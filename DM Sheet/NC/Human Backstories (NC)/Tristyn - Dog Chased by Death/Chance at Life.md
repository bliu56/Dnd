Dog Chased by Death's day began like any other, the hum of the city a dissonant lullaby as he prepared for another grim assignment. The crime lord's demand this time was a hefty sum from a known informant. The route took him through the city's darker veins, where shadows whispered secrets and the air was thick with despair.
As he approached the decrepit building, a figure emerged from the alley, stepping into his path. The man was nondescript, dressed in a plain coat and hat, his eyes a deep well of calm amidst the chaos.
~~Dog Chased by Death tensed, hand instinctively moving towards his weapon.~~
~~"Easy there," the man spoke softly, his voice carrying an unexpected warmth. "I'm not your enemy."~~
~~Dog's grip tightened. "Then you’d better explain quickly."~~
~~The man raised his hands in a placating gesture. "I'm here to help you. I know who you are, and I know what you want – freedom."~~
~~Dog's eyes narrowed, suspicion coiling in his chest. "Why should I believe you?"~~
~~The man stepped closer, his movements deliberate and unthreatening. "Because I have something that can change your life." He reached into his coat slowly, pulling out a small card. "This address is your way out."~~
~~Dog glanced at the card, skepticism mingling with a flicker of hope. "And why would you help me?"~~
"Let's just say," the man replied, a faint smile playing on his lips, "There is some benefit in this for me as much as it does for you. Meet me there tomorrow night. You'll understand."
Before Dog could respond, the man turned and vanished into the shadows, leaving behind an air of enigmatic promise.
Dog stared at the card, weighing the possibility of a trap against the desperate need for liberation. The address seemed to burn into his memory, a beacon of potential salvation.
As he pocketed the card and resumed his task, his thoughts were a tumultuous storm. The collection was routine, his presence once again eliciting fear and compliance. But the encounter with the mysterious man lingered in his mind, a tantalizing taste of a life beyond the boss’s iron grip.
