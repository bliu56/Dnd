## It begins
### Bills
## Morning: The Quiet Departure
The player wakes to the sound of the front door closing. Their father has left unusually early for his first day at a new job. On the kitchen table is a rushed note apologizing for not waking them and promising that “things will get better soon.”
The apartment is cold because the heating has been running low for weeks, and the nearly empty fridge is a silent reminder that money has been tight.
On the counter is a stack of opened envelopes the father must have reviewed late at night. Some are positioned neatly; others are shoved halfway under a placemat, suggesting he didn’t want the player to see them.
---
## Scene 1: The Envelope Choice
The player can choose to ignore the mail or look through it.
If they look:
- A utility bill with a red “FINAL NOTICE.”
- A medical bill for an old injury of the father’s, unpaid for months.
- A letter from the landlord about rising rent beginning next month.
- A bank envelope showing overdraft fees.
The dates reveal something alarming. The new job did not come soon enough, or it pays less than promised.
If the player does not look, the consequences show later in subtler ways.

## Scene 2: Transit to School
On the way to the rich high-school, the socioeconomic contrast is highlighted.
They walk past clean neighborhoods, well-kept cars, and students being dropped off by parents in luxury vehicles.
Their bus pass may be close to expiring, or the driver warns them, “You’re out of rides after today.”
A friend from school waves them over but casually mentions something that widens the gap, such as a planned ski trip or expensive club dues.
---
## Scene 3: School Day – Subtle Pressures
The school itself provides multiple opportunities for the player to feel the strain.
### Option A: Academic Pressure
A teacher pulls them aside and says the scholarship will be reviewed next month. They must maintain high performance or risk losing it.
### Option B: Club or Supply Costs
A class requires a specialized calculator, lab materials, or art supplies. Everyone else has them already. The teacher says there are loaners available, but only in limited quantity and the player must sign paperwork acknowledging they will be charged if damaged.
### Option C: Social Pressure
Peers discuss weekend plans requiring money. Someone accidentally assumes the player’s family has the resources for it. When the player declines, the friend seems confused but not malicious.
All of these reinforce that money is tighter than the father let on.
---
## Scene 4: Unexpected Call
Near lunchtime, the school office calls the student in.
A notice arrived because the family is behind on part of a school fee connected to the scholarship’s administrative costs. It is small by affluent-family standards but significant for the player—something like a transportation copay, an exam processing fee, or a textbook security deposit.
The office clerk explains that the father has not responded to multiple messages. The clerk assumes the parent is simply busy with the new job, but the player knows he has been overwhelmed.
This is the first concrete sign that the financial situation is worsening.
---
## Scene 5: After School – The Trigger
When the player gets home, the father is not back yet.
The apartment feels heavier than in the morning. On the kitchen table is a single new envelope. It is from the bank. It was slid under the front door.
Opening it (or finding it later) reveals:
- An account low-balance warning.
- A letter stating that the father’s first paycheck may not clear in time to avoid penalties.
- Or notice that the bank is withdrawing money automatically for overdue payments, leaving the account near zero.
There is a small handwritten note from the father on a scrap of paper nearby: “We’ll figure this out. Don’t worry.”
It reads more like he’s trying to convince himself.
---
## Evening: Choice Point
The father returns looking exhausted. His uniform still has the store tag pinned on, meaning he had no time to remove it. He tries to act upbeat, asking about their day, cooking a cheap dinner, and talking about “new beginnings.”
If the player confronts him, he tries to downplay the financial crisis.
If the player remains quiet, he continues the façade, which may worsen the situation later.
This moment sets the emotional tone for the campaign’s real-world arc: the parent is struggling silently, and the player is beginning to shoulder knowledge they were never meant to carry.
### Pain
## Scene 1: Small Clues Before School
As the player prepares for school, more signs appear.
On the counter is a bottle of over-the-counter painkillers missing far more tablets than normal.
His work boots are scuffed with a thin smear of dried blood near the toe.
A voicemail notification blinks on his phone. He ignores it and pockets the device.
The player can investigate or leave for school.
If they listen to the voicemail, they hear a supervisor saying something like:
“We reviewed the incident report. You really should get that checked out. If you can’t lift today, let us know before your shift.”
This is the first undeniable confirmation that something happened.
---
## Scene 2: School Under a Cloud
Throughout the school day, the player is distracted.
A teacher notices and asks if everything is alright.
A friend mentions how dangerous warehouse or construction work can be, even casually, which sharpens the player’s worry.
Homework assignments pile up but feel trivial compared to what is happening at home.
The tension is constant but quiet.
---
## Scene 3: After School – The Shift Begins
When the player gets home, the father has already left for work. His lunch container is still on the table, untouched.
He forgot it because he left in a hurry.
On the table is the incident report slip. It was left face-down, perhaps by accident.
Reading it reveals:
- A minor machinery malfunction.
- A falling crate.
- A slip while carrying heavy stock.
- A cut from sharp metal at the job.
It notes that he should “seek medical evaluation” but that doing so might require filling out additional paperwork.
There is also a line about “light duty may be available,” which usually pays less.
The player can keep the note, leave it, or attempt to meet their father later.
---
## Scene 4: The Father Returns
Late at night, the father comes home limping.
He tries to hide it, hanging his jacket quickly and shifting his weight to one leg.
He tries to act cheerful, asking about their day. The bandage is now soaked through beneath the sleeve.
He waves off the player’s concern with predictable excuses:
“It looks worse than it is.”
“Hospital bills are a trap.”
“If I miss a shift, they’ll replace me.”
“We’re already behind. I can’t stop now.”
His voice cracks once, betraying pain he can’t mask.
---
## Scene 5: Collapse of the Façade
As he tries to make dinner, he drops a pan because his grip fails. The clatter is loud and frightening.
He leans on the counter, breathing hard.
For a moment, he looks like he might pass out.
He forces himself upright, muttering that he is fine.
This is the scene where the player has a real choice to make. They can:
- Confront him directly and insist on medical help.
- Try to call someone: a relative, a neighbor, or an emergency hotline.
- Quietly help him without challenging him.
- Pretend nothing is wrong but worry internally.
- Take matters into their own hands by researching injury care, workers’ compensation, or first aid.
Each option can branch the real-world arc differently in future sessions.
