[[Chapter 0 - Setup]]
## Checking in
### **Scene 1: Overhearing the Parents**
**Setting:** Early evening in the family home, living room and kitchen.
**Tone:** Tense, secretive, slightly ominous.
**Scenario:**
- The player and younger sister are in the house, perhaps doing homework or chores. The parents are in the kitchen or study, talking quietly but not realizing the kids can hear.
- Fragments of conversation reach the player:
    
    - Father: “…maybe it’s time I call in a favor… old contacts could… handle things differently.”
    
    - Mother: “…be careful. You know what happened last time we tried going that route…”
    
    - Father: “…I just want him back… I can’t sit here waiting forever…”
    
**Player Choice/Interaction:**
- Try to eavesdrop further (and risk getting caught)
- Confront parents directly
- Say nothing but worry silently
**Potential Consequences:**
- If they confront: parents may give a vague explanation (“we’re thinking about options”) but nothing concrete.
- If they stay silent: seeds of curiosity and tension, maybe prompting the player to investigate themselves or turn to fantasy-world strategies.

### **Scene 2: College Friends of the Older Brother Visit**
**Setting:** Afternoon, front porch or living room.
**Tone:** Concerned, supportive, slightly mysterious.
**Scenario:**
- The player and younger sister hear the doorbell. It’s two or three college-aged visitors, friends of the missing older brother.
- They introduce themselves casually:
    
    - “Hi, we’re friends of [older brother]. We wanted to check if there’s anything we can do to help.”
    
- They may ask routine questions about when he was last seen, how the family is coping, etc.
- Unbeknownst to the player, these friends were part of the brother’s fantasy-party group and have been secretly tracking any leads in both worlds.
**Player Choice/Interaction:**
- Welcome them and share everything the family knows
- Keep them at a distance, wary of strangers
- Ask probing questions about the brother (risking them revealing hints about the fantasy world)
**Potential Consequences:**
- These friends can drop subtle hints about things the player doesn’t know yet (for example, “he always talked about a place no one could reach…”), seeding future quests.
- They can become allies, offering knowledge, resources, or contacts for the player in the real world that eventually tie into fantasy-world actions.

### **Scene 3: Subtle Clues and Rumors**
**Setting:** Same day or following day; kitchen, backyard, or even the street outside school.
**Tone:** Quiet, reflective, tension-building.
**Scenario:**
- The player notices small things that hint at parents’ secret networks:
    
    - A letter addressed to a criminal organization contact slipped under the door
    
    - A brief conversation with the father on the phone, vague and tense
    
    - Unfamiliar car parked outside the house for a few minutes, then gone
    
**Player Choice/Interaction:**
- Investigate these clues themselves
- Ask parents about them (risking evasive or angry reactions)
- Ignore, focus on school or fantasy-world investigations
**Potential Consequences:**
- Can trigger a chain where the player realizes their real-world father has resources—and enemies—they didn’t know existed.
- Can affect the player’s decision-making in the fantasy world (maybe using real-world connections).
