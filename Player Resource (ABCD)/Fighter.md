# Summary
---
Fighters rule many battlefields. Questing knights, royal champions, elite soldiers, and hardened mercenaries - as Fighters, they all share an unparalleled prowess with weapons and armor. And they are well acquainted with death, both meting it out and defying it.
Fighters master various weapon techniques, and a well-equipped Fighter always has the right tool at hand for any combat situation. Likewise, a Fighter is adept with every form of armor. Beyond that basic degree of familiarity, each Fighter specializes in certain styles of combat. Some concentrate on archery, some on fighting with two weapons at once, and some on augmenting their martial skills with magic. This combination of broad ability and extensive specialization makes Fighters superior combatants.

### Level 3: Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an Eldritch Knight.
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Feature|Description|
|Cantrips|You know two cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list (see that class’s section for its list). Ray of Frost and Shocking Grasp are recommended. Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Wizard spell list. When you reach Fighter level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.|
|Spell Slots|The Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.|
|Prepared Spells of Level 1+|You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 spells from the Wizard spell list. Burning Hands, Jump, and Shield are recommended. The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Fighter levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Eldritch Knight Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Wizard spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 7 Fighter, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.|
|Changing Your Prepared Spells|Whenever you gain a Fighter level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.|
|Spellcasting Ability|Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.|
|Spellcasting Focus|You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.|
### Level 3: War Bond
You learn a ritual that creates a magical bond between yourself and one weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a Short Rest. The weapon must be within your reach throughout the ritual, at the conclusion of which you touch the weapon and forge the bond. The bond fails if another Fighter is bonded to the weapon or if the weapon is a magic item to which someone else is attuned.
Once you have bonded a weapon to yourself, you can’t be disarmed of that weapon unless you have the Incapacitated condition. If it is on the same plane of existence, you can summon that weapon as a Bonus Action, causing it to teleport instantly to your hand.
You can have up to two bonded weapons, but you can summon only one at a time with a Bonus Action. If you attempt to bond with a third weapon, you must break the bond with one of the other two.
### Level 7: War Magic
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace one of the attacks with a casting of one of your Wizard cantrips that has a casting time of an action.
### Level 10: Eldritch Strike
You learn how to make your weapon strikes undercut a creature’s ability to withstand your spells. When you hit a creature with an attack using a weapon, that creature has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes against a spell you cast before the end of your next turn.
### Level 15: Arcane Charge
When you use your Action Surge, you can teleport up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. You can teleport before or after the additional action.
### Level 18: Improved War Magic
When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can replace two of the attacks with a casting of one of your level 1 or level 2 Wizard spells that has a casting time of an action.
## Psi Warrior
_Augment Physical Might with Psionic Power_
Psi Warriors awaken the power of their minds to augment their physical might. They harness this psionic power to infuse their weapon strikes, lash out with telekinetic energy, and create barriers of mental force.
### Level 3: Psionic Power
You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by your Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel powers you have from this subclass. The Psi Warrior Energy Dice table shows the die size and number of these dice you have when you reach certain Fighter levels.
### Psi Warrior Energy Dice
|Fighter Level|Die Size|Number|
|---|---|---|
|3|D6|4|
|5|D8|6|
|9|D8|8|
|11|D10|8|
|13|D10|10|
|17|D12|12|
Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend the Psionic Energy Die, as specified in a power’s description, and you can’t use a power if it requires you to use a die when all your Psionic Energy Dice are expended.
You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all of them when you finish a Long Rest.
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Protective Field|When you or another creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can take a Reaction to expend one Psionic Energy Die, roll the die, and reduce the damage taken by the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier (minimum reduction of 1), as you create a momentary shield of telekinetic force.|
|Psionic Strike|You can propel your weapons with psionic force. Once on each of your turns, immediately after you hit a target within 30 feet of yourself with an attack and deal damage to it with a weapon, you can expend one Psionic Energy Die, rolling it and dealing Force damage to the target equal to the number rolled plus your Intelligence modifier.|
|Telekinetic Movement|You can move an object or a creature with your mind. As a Magic action, choose one target you can see within 30 feet of yourself; the target must be a loose object that is Large or smaller or one willing creature other than you. You transport the target up to 30 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. Alternatively, if the target is a Tiny object, you can transport it to or from your hand. Once you take this action, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.|
### Level 7: Telekinetic Adept
You have mastered new ways to use your telekinetic abilities, detailed below.
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Psi-Powered Leap|As a Bonus Action, you gain a Fly Speed equal to twice your Speed until the end of the current turn. Once you take this Bonus Action, you can’t do so again until you finish a Short or Long Rest unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.|
|Telekinetic Thrust|When you deal damage to a target with your Psionic Strike, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Intelligence modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, you can give the target the Prone condition or transport it up to 10 feet horizontally.|
### Level 10: Guarded Mind
You have Resistance to Psychic damage. Moreover, if you start your turn with the Charmed or Frightened condition, you can expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) and end every effect on yourself giving you those conditions.
### Level 15: Bulwark of Force
You can shield yourself and others with telekinetic force. As a Bonus Action, you can choose creatures, including yourself, within 30 feet of yourself, up to a number of creatures equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one creature). Each of the chosen creatures has Half Cover for 1 minute or until you have the Incapacitated condition.
Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.
### Level 18: Telekinetic Master
You always have the [telekinesis](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:telekinesis) spell prepared. With this feature, you can cast it without a spell slot or components, and your spellcasting ability for it is Intelligence. On each of your turns while you maintain Concentration on it, including the turn when you cast it, you can make one attack with a weapon as a Bonus Action.
Once you cast the spell with this feature, you can’t do so in this way again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.
