# Summary

Clerics draw power from the realms of the gods and harness it to work miracles. Blessed by a deity, a pantheon, or another immortal entity, a Cleric can reach out to the divine magic of the Outer Planes—where gods dwell—and channel it to bolster people and battle foes.
Because their power is a divine gift, Clerics typically associate themselves with temples dedicated to the deity or other immortal force that unlocked their magic. Harnessing divine magic doesn’t rely on specific training, yet Clerics might learn prayers and rites that help them draw on power from the Outer Planes.
Not every member of a temple or shrine is a Cleric. Some priests are called to a simple life of temple service, carrying out their devotion through prayer and rituals, not through magic. Many mortals claim to speak for the gods, but few can marshal the power of those gods the way a Cleric can.

# Leveling

# Levels

## Level 1

### Divine Order

You have dedicated yourself to one of the following sacred roles of your choice.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Protector|Trained for battle, you gain proficiency with Martial weapons and training with Heavy armor.|
|Thaumaturge|You know one extra cantrip from the Cleric spell list. In addition, your mystical connection to the divine gives you a bonus to your Intelligence (Arcana or Religion) checks. The bonus equals your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1).|

### Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules with Cleric spells, which appear on the Cleric spell list later in the class’s description.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Cantrips|You know three cantrips of your choice from the Cleric spell list. Guidance, Sacred Flame, and Thaumaturgy are recommended.  <br>  <br>Whenever you gain a Cleric level, you can replace one of your cantrips with another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list.  <br>  <br>When you reach Cleric levels 4 and 10, you learn another cantrip of your choice from the Cleric spell list, as shown in the Cantrips column of the Cleric Features table.|
|Spell Slots|The Cleric Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.|
|Prepared Spells of Level 1+|You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose four level 1 spells from the Cleric spell list. Bless, Cure Wounds, Guiding Bolt, and Shield of Faith are recommended.  <br>  <br>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Cleric levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Cleric Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Cleric spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you’re a level 3 Cleric, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.  <br>  <br>If another Cleric feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Cleric spells for you.|
|Changing Your Prepared Spells|Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Cleric spells for which you have spell slots.|
|Spellcasting Ability|Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Cleric spells.|
|Spellcasting Focus|You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Cleric spells.|

## Level 2

### Channel Divinity

You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes to fuel magical effects. You start with two such effects: Divine Spark and Turn Undead, each of which is described below. Each time you use this class’s Channel Divinity, choose which Channel Divinity effect from this class to create. You gain additional effect options at higher Cleric levels.
You can use this class’s Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain additional uses when you reach certain Cleric levels, as shown in the Channel Divinity column of the Cleric Features table.
If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class’s Spellcasting feature.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Divine Spark|As a Magic action, you point your Holy Symbol at another creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself and focus divine energy at it. Roll 1d8 and add your Wisdom modifier. You either restore Hit Points to the creature equal to that total or force the creature to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice) equal to that total. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage (round down).  <br>  <br>You roll an additional d8 when you reach Cleric levels 7 (2d8), 13 (3d8), and 18 (4d8).|
|Turn Undead|As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and censure Undead creatures. Each Undead of your choice within 30 feet of you must make a Wisdom saving throw. If the creature fails its save, it has the Frightened and Incapacitated conditions for 1 minute. For that duration, it tries to move as far from you as it can on its turns. This effect ends early on the creature if it takes any damage, if you have the Incapacitated condition, or if you die.|

## Level 3

### Subclass

You gain a subclass of your choice. [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Cleric|Cleric]]

## Level 4

You gain the [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]] or another [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

## Level 5

### Sear Undead

Whenever you use Turn Undead, you can roll a number of d8s equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of 1d8) and add the rolls together. Each Undead that fails its saving throw against that use of Turn Undead takes Radiant damage equal to the roll’s total. This damage doesn’t end the turn effect.

## Level 6

Check Subclass

## Level 7

### Blessed Strikes

Divine power infuses you in battle. You gain one of the following options of your choice (if you get either option from a Cleric subclass in an older book, use only the option you choose for this feature).

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Divine Strike|Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with an attack roll using a weapon, you can cause the target to take an extra 1d8 Necrotic or Radiant damage (your choice).|
|Potent Spellcasting|Add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any Cleric cantrip.|

## Level 8

You gain the [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]] or another [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

## Level 9

## Level 10

You can call on your deity or pantheon to intervene on your behalf. As a Magic action, choose any Cleric spell of level 5 or lower that doesn’t require a Reaction to cast. As part of the same action, you cast that spell without expending a spell slot or needing Material components. You can’t use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Level 11

## Level 12

You gain the [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]] or another [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

## Level 15

## Level 16

You gain the [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]] or another [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

## Level 17

## Level 18

## Level 19

### Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Fate is recommended.

## Level 20

### Greater Divine Intervention

You can call on even more powerful divine intervention. When you use your Divine Intervention feature, you can choose Wish when you select a spell. If you do so, you can’t use Divine Intervention again until you finish 2d4 Long Rests.

# SubClass

## Life Domain

_Soothe the Hurts of the World_
The Life Domain focuses on the positive energy that helps sustain all life in the multiverse. Clerics who tap into this domain are masters of healing, using that life force to cure many hurts.
Existence itself relies on the positive energy associated with this domain, so a Cleric of almost any religious tradition might choose it. This domain is particularly associated with agricultural deities, gods of healing or endurance, and gods of home and community. Religious orders of healing also seek the magic of this domain.

### Level 3: Disciple of Life

When a spell you cast with a spell slot restores Hit Points to a creature, that creature regains additional Hit Points on the turn you cast the spell. The additional Hit Points equal 2 plus the spell slot’s level.

### Level 3: Preserve Life

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to evoke healing energy that can restore a number of Hit Points equal to five times your Cleric level. Choose Bloodied creatures within 30 feet of yourself (which can include you), and divide those Hit Points among them. This feature can restore a creature to no more than half its Hit Point maximum.

### Level 3: Life Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

|Cleric Level|Prepared Spells|
|---|---|
|3|Aid, Bless, Cure Wounds Lesser Restoration|
|5|Mass Healing-Word, Revivify|
|7|Aura of Life, Death Ward|
|9|Greater Restoration, Mass Cure Wounds|

### Level 6: Blessed Healer

The healing spells you cast on others heal you as well. Immediately after you cast a spell with a spell slot that restores Hit Points to one or more creatures other than yourself, you regain Hit Points equal to 2 plus the spell slot’s level.

### Level 17: Supreme Healing

When you would normally roll one or more dice to restore Hit Points to a creature with a spell or Channel Divinity, don’t roll those dice for the healing; instead use the highest number possible for each die. For example, instead of restoring 2d6 Hit Points to a creature with a spell, you restore 12.

## Life Domain

_Bring Light to Banish Darkness_
The Light Domain emphasizes the divine power to bring about blazing fire and revelation. Clerics who wield this power are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their deities’ discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.
The Light Domain is associated with gods of truth, vigilance, beauty, insight, and renewal. Some of these gods are identified with the sun or as charioteers who guide the sun across the sky. Others are sentinels who pierce deception. Some are deities of beauty and artistry who teach that art is a vehicle for the soul’s improvement.

### Level 3: Warding Flare

When a creature that you can see within 30 feet of yourself makes an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to impose Disadvantage on the attack roll, causing light to flare before it hits or misses.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

### Level 3: Radiance of the Dawn

As a Magic action, you present your Holy Symbol and expend a use of your Channel Divinity to emit a flash of light in a 30-foot Emanation originating from yourself. Any magical Darkness—such as that created by the Darkness spell—in that area is dispelled. Additionally, each creature of your choice in that area must make a Constitution saving throw, taking Radiant damage equal to 2d10 plus your Cleric level on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

### Level 3: Light Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

|Cleric Level|Prepared Spells|
|---|---|
|3|Burning Hands, Faerie Fire, Scorching Ray|
|5|Daylight, Fireball|
|7|Arcane Eye, Wall of Fire|
|9|Flame Strike, Scrying|

### Level 6: Improved Warding Flare

You regain all expended uses of your Warding Flare when you finish a Short or Long Rest.
In addition, whenever you use Warding Flare, you can give the target of the triggering attack a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to 2d6 plus your Wisdom modifier.

### Level 17: Corona of Light

As a Magic action, you cause yourself to emit an aura of sunlight that lasts for 1 minute or until you dismiss it (no action required). You emit Bright Light in a 60-foot radius and Dim Light for an additional 30 feet. Your enemies in the Bright Light have Disadvantage on saving throws against your Radiance of the Dawn and any spell that deals Fire or Radiant damage.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

## Trickery Domain

_Make Mischief and Challenge Authority_
The Trickery Domain offers magic of deception, illusion, and stealth. Clerics who wield this magic are a disruptive force in the world, puncturing pride, mocking tyrants, freeing captives, and flouting hollow traditions. They prefer subterfuge and pranks to direct confrontation.
Gods of trickery are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals. They embody the forces of change and social upheaval, and they’re patrons of thieves, scoundrels, gamblers, rebels, and liberators. Religious orders that operate in secret, especially those that seek to undermine oppressive governments or hierarchies, also draw on the power of the Trickery Domain.

### Level 3: Blessing of the Trickster

As a Magic action, you can choose yourself or a willing creature within 30 feet of yourself to have Advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. This blessing lasts until you finish a Long Rest or you use this feature again.

### Level 3: Invoke Duplicity

As a Bonus Action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to create a perfect visual illusion of yourself in an unoccupied space you can see within 30 feet of yourself. The illusion is intangible and doesn’t occupy its space. It lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you dismiss it (no action required) or have the Incapacitated condition. The illusion is animated and mimics your expressions and gestures. While it persists, you gain the following benefits.

|**Action**|**Effect**|
|---|---|
|Cast Spells|Cast spells from illusion's space using your own senses|
|Distract|Gain Advantage on attack rolls against creatures within 5 feet of both you and your illusion|
|Move|Bonus Action to move illusion up to 30 feet within 120 feet of you|

### Level 3: Trickery Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Life Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

|Cleric Level|Prepared Spells|
|---|---|
|3|Charm Person, Disguise Self, Invisibility, Pass without Trace|
|5|Hypnotic Pattern, Nondetection|
|7|Confusion, Dimension Door|
|9|Dominate Person, Modify Memory|

### Level 6: Trickster’s Transposition

Whenever you take the Bonus Action to create or move the illusion of your Invoke Duplicity, you can teleport, swapping places with the illusion.

### Level 17: Improved Duplicity

The illusion of your Invoke Duplicity has grown more powerful in the following ways.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Feature|Effect|
|Shared Distraction|You and your allies have Advantage on attack rolls against creatures within 5 feet of the illusion|
|Healing Illusion|When illusion ends, you or a chosen creature within 5 feet regains Hit Points equal to your Cleric level|

## War Domain

_Inspire Valor and Smite Foes_
War has many manifestations. It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. Clerics who tap into the magic of the War Domain excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers.
Gods of the War Domain watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. They include champions of honor and chivalry as well as gods of destruction and pillage. Other war gods take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.

### Level 3: Guided Strike

When you or a creature within 30 feet of you misses with an attack roll, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity and give that roll a +10 bonus, potentially causing it to hit. When you use this feature to benefit another creature’s attack roll, you must take a Reaction to do so.

### Level 3: War Priest

As a Bonus Action, you can make one attack with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike. You can use this Bonus Action a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a Short or Long Rest.

### Level 3: War Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the War Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

|Cleric Level|Prepared Spells|
|---|---|
|3|Guiding Bolt, Magic Weapon, Shield of Faith, Spiritual Weapon|
|5|Crusader's Mantle, Spirit Guardians|
|7|Fire Shield, Freedom of Movement|
|9|Hold Monster, Steel Wind Strike|

### Level 6: War God’s Blessing

You can expend a use of your Channel Divinity to cast Shield of Faith or Spiritual Weapon rather than expending a spell slot. When you cast either spell in this way, the spell doesn’t require Concentration. Instead the spell lasts for 1 minute, but it ends early if you cast that spell again, have the Incapacitated condition, or die.

### Level 17: Avatar of Battle

You gain Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.

## Shrine Warden Domain

Across the realms and beyond exist countless deities and spirits, each with their own motivations, power, and temperament, and each with their own devoted followers. Shrine Warden clerics celebrate and honour the deities they follow through the creation and preservation of hallowed sites in their honour—consecrated ground where the misty division between spiritual and physical melts away to nothing.
To such clerics, power can be drawn from almost any kaiju, spirit, deity, or pantheon they worship. For the Shrine Warden, the act of devotion itself is magical, and the erection of a shrine a beacon of hope to those in need, and of terror to those who mean it harm.

### Level 3: Channel Divinity - Consecration

You can use your Channel Divinity to imbue an area with divine magic. As a bonus action, you target a point within 60 feet of you, causing a small, spectral shrine to appear and radiate magic in a 20-foot-radius aura for the next 10 minutes.
When you use this feature, choose a Blessing or Curse from the options below, and then choose a number of creatures you can see up to 1 + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of one creature) to be affected by the shrine’s magic.

|Aura Effect|Description|
|---|---|
|Blessing of Fortune|An affected creature can add 1d4 to an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw. It can decide after rolling but before the outcome is determined. It can't gain this benefit again until the start of its next turn.|
|Blessing of Power|When an affected creature hits a target with an attack, it deals an extra 1d6 radiant damage. This benefit resets at the start of its next turn. It increases to 2d6 at 11th level.|
|Blessing of Hope|An affected creature is immune to the frightened condition and gains 1d4 temporary hit points when it ends its turn in the aura.|
|Curse of the Void|An affected creature entering or starting its turn in the aura must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the start of its next turn.|
|Curse of Pain|An affected creature takes 1d8 necrotic damage when entering or starting its turn in the aura. This increases to 2d8 at 11th level.|
|Curse of Panic|An affected creature entering or starting its turn in the aura must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened until the start of its next turn.|

### Level 3: Shrine Warden Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Shrine Warden Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

|Cleric Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|1st|protection from evil and good, sanctuary|
|3rd|protection*, silence|
|5th|dispel magic, extract shirikodama*|
|7th|guardian of faith, rock tomb*|
|9th|Bakuryō’s blessèd blizzard*, magatsuchi’s lantern*|

### Level 6: Shrine Guardian

When you create a shrine with your Consecration Channel Divinity feature, you also summon a Tiny Fey (yokai) spirit to act as its guardian. This shrine guardian is immune to all damage and conditions and can fly. As a bonus action on your turn, you can command it to move the shrine up to 20 feet in any direction.
The shrine guardian can also help or hinder nearby creatures. When a creature in the shrine’s aura makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can use your reaction to command the shrine guardian to intervene, rolling 1d4 and applying it as a bonus or penalty (your choice) to the creature’s roll. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier, regaining all expended uses upon finishing a long rest.

### Level 8: Divine Strike

You gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 radiant damage to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.

### Level 17: Empowered Consecration

When you use your Consecration Channel Divinity feature, the radius of the shrine’s aura increases to 30 feet. In addition, you can choose all three Blessing or all three Curse options to affect creatures you designate with this feature, rather than just one option.
