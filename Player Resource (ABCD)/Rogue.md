# Summary

Rogues rely on cunning, stealth, and their foes' vulnerabilities to get the upper hand in any situation. They have a knack for finding the solution to just about any problem. A few even learn magical tricks to supplement their other abilities. Many Rogues focus on stealth and deception, while others refine skills that help them in a dungeon environment, such as climbing, finding and disarming traps and opening locks.
In combat, Rogues prioritize subtle strikes over brute strength. They would rather make on precise strike than wear an opponent down with a barrage of blows.
Some Rogues began their careers as criminals, while other used their cunning to fight crime. Whatever a Rogue's relation to the law, no common criminal or officer of the law can match the subtle brilliance of the greatest Rogues.

### Sneak Attack

You know how to strike subtly and exploit a foe's distraction. Once per turn you can deal an extra 1d6 damage to one creature you hit with an attack roll if you have Advantage on the roll and the attack uses a Finesse or a Ranged weapon. The extra damage's type is the same was the weapon's type.

The extra damage increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Sneak Attack column of the Rogue Features table.

Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Shortswords.

### Cunning Strike

You've developed cunning ways to use your Sneak Attack. When you deal Sneak Attack damage, you can add one of the following Cunning Strike effects. Each effect has a die cost, which is the number of Sneak Attack dice you must forgo to add the effect. You remove the die before rolling, and the effect occurs immediately after the attack's damage is dealt. For example, if you add the Poison effect, remove 1d6 from the Sneak Attack's damage before rolling.
If a Cunning Strike requires a saving throw, the DC equals 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Poison (Cost: 1d6)|You add a toxin to your strike, forcing the target to make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the target has the Poisoned condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of its turns, the poisoned target repeats the save, ending the effect on a success.  <br>  <br>To use this effect, you must have a Poisoner's Kit on your person.|

### Level 3: Spellcasting

You have learned to cast spells. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The information below details how you use those rules as an Arcane Trickster.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Feature|Description|
|Cantrips|You know three cantrips: Mage Hand and two other cantrips of your choice from the Wizard spell list (See that class's section for its list). Mind Sliver and Minor Illusion are recommended.  <br>  <br>Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one of your cantrips, except Mage Hand, with another Wizard cantrip of your choice.  <br>  <br>When you reach Rogue level 10, you learn another Wizard cantrip of your choice.|
|Spell Slots|The Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a Long Rest.|
|Prepared Spells of Level 1+|You prepare a list of the level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose three level 1 Wizard spells. Charm Person, Disguise Self and Fog Cloud are recommended.  <br>  <br>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Rogue levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional Wizard spells until the number of spells on your list matches the number in the Arcane Trickster Spellcasting table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 7 Rogue, your list of prepared spells can include five Wizard spells of level 1 or 2 in any combination.|
|Changing Your Prepared Spells|Whenever you gain a Rogue level, you can replace one spell on your list with another Wizard spell for which you have spell slots.|
|Spellcasting Ability|Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your Wizard spells.|
|Spellcasting Focus|You can use an Arcane Focus as a Spellcasting Focus for your Wizard spells.|

### Level 3: Mage Hand Legerdemain

When you cast [Mage Hand](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand), you can cast it as a Bonus Action, and you can make the spectral hand Invisible. You can control the hand as a Bonus Action, and through it, you can make Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) checks.

### Level 9: Magical Ambush

If you have the Invisible condition when you cast a spell on a creature, it has Disadvantage on any saving throw it makes against the spell on the same turn.

### Level 13: Versatile Trickster

You gain the ability to distract targets with your [Mage Hand](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:mage-hand). When you use the Trip option of your Cunning Strike on a creature, you can also use that option on another creature within 5 feet of the spectral hand.

### Level 17: Spell Thief

You gain the ability to magically steal the knowledge of how to cast a spell from another spellcaster.
Immediately after a creature casts a spell that targets you or includes you in its area of effect, you can take a Reaction to force the creature to make an Intelligence saving throw. The DC equals your spell save DC. On a failed save, you negate the spell's effect against you, and you steal the knowledge of the spell if it is at least level 1 and of a level you can cast (it doesn't need to be a Wizard spell). For the next 8 hours, you have the spell prepared. The creature can't cast it until 8 hours have passed.
Once you steal a spell with this feature, you can't use this feature again until you finish a Long Rest.

## Assassin

_Practice the Grim Art of Death_
An Assassin's training focuses on using stealth, poison, and disguise to eliminate foes with deadly efficiency. While some Rogues who follow this path are hired killers, spies, or bounty hunters, the capabilities of this subclass are equally useful for adventurers facing a variety of monstrous enemies.

You're adept at ambushing a target, granting you the following benefits.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Initiative|You have Advantage on Initiative rolls.|

## Soulknife

_Strike Foes with Psionic Blades_
A Soulknife strikes with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These Rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. As a Soulknife your psionic abilities might have haunted you since childhood, revealing their full potential only as you experienced the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out an order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your power.

### Level 3: Psionic Power

You harbor a wellspring of psionic energy within yourself. It is represented by your Psionic Energy Dice, which fuel certain powers you have from this subclass. The Soulknife Energy Dice table shows the number of these dice you have when you reach certain Rogue levels, and the table shows the die size.

### Soulknife Energy Dice

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Rogue Level|Die Size|Number|
|3|D6|4|
|5|D8|6|
|9|D8|8|
|11|D10|8|
|13|D10|10|
|17|D12|12|

Any features in this subclass that use a Psionic Energy Die use only the dice from this subclass. Some of your powers expend a Psionic Energy Die, as specified in the power's description, and you can't use the power if it requires you to use a die when your Psionic Energy Dice are all expended.
You regain one of your expended Psionic Energy Dice when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all of them when you finish a Long Rest.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Psi-Bolstered Knack|If you fail an ability check using a skill or tool with which you have proficiency, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the check, potentially turning failure into success. The die is expended only if the roll then succeeds.|
|Psychic Whispers|You can establish telepathic communication between yourself and others. As a Magic action, choose one or more creatures you can see, up to a number of creatures equal to your Proficiency Bonus, and then roll one Psionic Energy Die. For a number of hours equal to the number rolled, the chosen creatures can speak telepathically to you, and you can speak telepathically with them. To send or receive a message (no action required), you and the other creature must be within 1 mile of each other. A creature can end the telepathic connection at any time (no action required).|

|Damage on a Hit|1d6 Psychic plus the ability modifier used for the attack roll|
|Properties|Finesse, Thrown (range 60/120 feet)|

### Level 9: Soul Blades

You can now use the following powers with your Psychic Blades.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Homing Strikes|If you make an attack roll with your Psychic Blade and miss the target, you can roll one Psionic Energy Die and add the number rolled to the attack roll. If this causes the attack to hit, the die is expended.|
|Psychic Teleportation|As a Bonus Action, you manifest a Psychic Blade, expend one Psionic Energy Die and roll it, and throw the blade at an unoccupied space you can see up to a number of feet away equal to 10 times the number rolled. You then teleport to that space, and the blade vanishes.|

### Level 13: Psychic Veil

You can weave a veil of psychic static to mask yourself. As a Magic action, you gain the Invisible condition for 1 hour or until you dismiss the effect (no action required). This invisibility ends early immediately after you deal damage to a creature or you force a creature to make a saving throw.
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a Psionic Energy Die (no action required) to restore your use of it.

### Level 17: Rend Mind

You can sweep your Psychic Blades through a creature's mind. When you use you Psychic Blades to deal Sneak Attack damage to a creature, you can force that target to make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Dexterity modifier and Proficiency Bonus). If the save fails, the target has the Stunned condition for 1 minute. The Stunned target repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.
Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend three Psionic Energy Dice (no action required) to restore your use of it.
