# Summary
---
Far from bustling cities, amid the trees of trackless forests and across wide plains, Rangers keep their unending watch in the wilderness. Rangers learn to track their quarry as a predator does, moving stealthily through the wilds and hiding themselves in brush and rubble.
Thanks to their connection with nature, Rangers can also cast spells that harness primal powers of the wilderness. A Ranger's talents and magic are honed with deadly focus to protect the world from the ravages of monsters and tyrants.

# Levels

## Level 1
### Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longbows and Shortswords.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For Example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Scimitars and Longswords.
### Favored Enemy
You always have the [Hunter's Mark](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:hunter-s-mark) spell prepared.
You can cast it twice without expending a spell slot, and you regain all expended uses of this ability when you finish a Long Rest.
The number of times you can cast the spell without a spell slot increases when you reach certain Ranger Levels, as shown in the Favored Enemy column of the Ranger Features table.
### Spellcasting
You have learned to channel the magical essence of nature to cast spells. See Chapter 7 for the rules on Spellcasting. The Information below details how you use those rules with Ranger spells, which appear in the [Ranger spell list](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/ranger:spell-list) later in the class's description.

|---|---|
|Spell Slots|The Ranger Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.|
|Prepared Spells of Level 1+|You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Ranger spells Cure Wounds and Ensnaring Strike are recommended.  <br>  <br>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Ranger levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Ranger Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Ranger spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Ranger, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.  <br>  <br>If another Ranger feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Ranger spells for you.|

If you have the Incapacitated condition, the beast acts on its own and isn't limited to the dodge action.
