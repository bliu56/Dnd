# Summary

Bare, clawed feet part river-rounded gravel as a tengu sweeps through motions as graceful as any dancer’s, the surging water parting to allow her and her weary companions a peaceful crossing.
With patient composure, an oniborne deflects a hail of flaming arrows, redirecting their heat into a cascade of blue flame and burning fists.
The clack of jagged obsidian, splash of glacial water, and warmth of flaming eddies gather within a rushing whirlwind. Drifting out of these massed elements is a glowing hanamori, a primordial incarnation of their mortal form.
These benders, as disparate as their affinities might be, are defined by their connection with the elements: a magic manifested through precise and practised movements. More than a martial art, their motions are a spectacular union of magical and physical virtuosity, each twist and flick a nuanced touch of the Weave. For some, this is a weapon of war, of thunderclaps and fists of rock. For others, this is a tool to preserve, to craft shields of ice and invigorate with an inner flame. Whether a bender chooses to study all the elements—earth, air, water, and fire—or to master just one, the primordial forces of nature are theirs to command.

# Leveling

# Levels

## Level 1

### Spellcasting

As a bender of elements, you use the motions of your corporeal form to coax the Weave into manipulating the primordial forces.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Cantrip|You know two cantrips of your choice from your bender spell list (see Elemental Affinity). At higher levels, you learn additional cantrips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Bender table. Your Elemental Affinity feature also allows you to learn more cantrips at higher levels.|
|Preparing and Casting Spells|The Bender table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your bender spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.  <br>  <br>You prepare the repertoire of bender spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from your bender spell list (see Elemental Affinity). When you do so, choose a number of these spells equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier + half your bender level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.  <br>  <br>For example, if you are a 5th-level bender, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With a spellcasting ability of 14, your repertoire of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell _thunderwave_, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn’t remove it from your repertoire of prepared spells.  <br>  <br>You can change your repertoire of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new repertoire of bender spells requires time spent practising their movements and gestures: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell in your repertoire.|
|Spellcasting Ability|When you gain your first level in this class, you choose which spellcasting ability you use for your bender spells from Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. You use this ability whenever a bender spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use this ability’s modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a bender spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.|
|Ritual Casting|You can cast a bender spell as a ritual if that spell has the ritual tag and you have the spell prepared.|
|Spellcasting Focus|You can use your free hand as a spellcasting focus for your bender spells. This free hand can be used for both the somatic and material components for a spell, provided the material component has no cost and isn’t consumed by the casting.|

### Elemental Affinity

You find attunement with one of the four elements. Choose one of the following: air, earth, fire, or water. The spells associated with that element (see Bender Spell List on page 164) are added to your bender spell list.
- **Air**: Thunder
- **Earth**: Acid & bludgeoning
- **Fire**: Fire & lightning
- **Water**: Cold
**At Higher Level:**
At 6th, 10th, and 14th levels, you choose one of the four elements to gain affinity with, either a new element or one you’ve chosen before. This has some immediate effects and interacts with some subclass features (see below).
- **New Elemental Affinity**:
    If you choose a new element with which to gain affinity, you add its spells to your bender spell list and you learn one cantrip of your choice from the new element’s list. This cantrip doesn’t count against the number of cantrips you know.
- **Repeated Elemental Affinity:**
    If you choose an element for which you already had affinity, spells that you cast from that spell list are cast one level higher than the level of spell slot you expend. This effect stacks; if you choose to gain affinity with the same element four times, your spells from that element’s list are cast three levels higher than the spell slot you expend.

### Elemental Strikes

You have learned to unite magic with movement, giving you a unique and deadly combat style. When you take the Attack action, you can make melee or ranged spell attacks called elemental strikes as one or more of your attacks. The strike deals damage of a type with which you have affinity (your choice when you make the attack).
- **Melee:**
    A melee elemental strike is an unarmed strike that has a reach of 10 feet and deals damage equal to 1d6 plus your bender spellcasting ability modifier on a hit.
- **Ranged**:
    A ranged elemental strike has a range of 60 feet and deals damage equal to 1d4 plus your bender spellcasting ability modifier on a hit.
This damage does not increase with level. However, any magic items that confer a bonus to the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes confer the same bonus to your elemental strikes. The superior strikes for these attacks are Flurry (for melee attacks) and Battery Strike (for ranged attacks), both unlocked by the tier 2 Pugilist advanced technique. See the Advanced Weapon Masteries chapter on page 83 for more details on superior strikes and advanced techniques.

## Level 2

### Elemental Combo

Your strikes manifest elemental energy, which you can unleash at the peak of your combination. On your turn, after you make a weapon attack or elemental strike, or after you cast a levelled spell from your bender spell list, you can release a jet of elemental energy as a bonus action. Make a spell attack against a creature within 60 feet of you. On a hit, it deals 1d4 damage of a type with which you have affinity. If the target of this attack is within 10 feet of you, you can add your spellcasting ability modifier to the damage.
**At Higher Levels:**
This attack's damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 6th level (2d4), 10th level (3d4), and 14th level (4d4) in this class.

## Level 3

### Subclass

You gain a Bender subclass of your choice. [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Bender|Bender]]

### Bender Discipline

You choose an aspect of how nature manifests, which you embody in your manipulation of the elements. Your discipline choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level.

## Level 4

You gain the [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]] or another [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

## Level 5

### Extra Attack

You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

### Fast Movement

Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armor.

## Level 6

Check Subclass

## Level 7

### Feral Instinct

Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.

### Instinctive Pounce

As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.

### Extra Attack

The fury of your attacks can knock a foe to the ground. When you take the Attack action and make an attack roll against a creature with advantage, if both of the d20 rolls would hit the target, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your attacking ability modifier). On a failure, you can choose to knock the target prone or push it up to 5 feet away from you. Creatures more than one size larger than you automatically succeed on this saving throw. You can use this feature once per turn.

## Level 8

You gain the [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]] or another [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

## Level 9

### Brutal Strike

If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn't have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice.
You have the following effect options.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Forceful Blow**|The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.|
|**Hamstring Blow**|The target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time— the most recent one.|

## Level 10

Check Subclass

## Level 11

### Relentless Rage

Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.
Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.

## Level 12

You gain the [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]] or another [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

## Level 13

### Improved Brutal Strike

You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Staggering Blow**|The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.|
|**Sundering Blow**|Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.|

## Level 14

Check Subclass

## Level 15

### Persistent Rage

When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.

## Level 16

You gain the [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]] or another [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

## Level 17

### Improved Brutal Strike

The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.

## Level 18

### Indomitable Might

If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.

## Level 19

### Epic Boon

You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended.

## Level 20

### Primal Champion

You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.

# SubClass

## Disciple of Ferocity

Disciples of Ferocity traverse battlefields as a whirlwind of blades, fists, and elemental fury. Whether it be with the deadly patience of a stalking predator or the reckless abandon of a raging barbarian, these benders rely on an unflinching offense as the solution to that which stands in their way. They are students of devastation. Armed and armored, their movements embody the destructive forces of nature: desolating wildfires, wrenching tornadoes, surging tsunamis, and rending earthquakes.
How did you come to follow such a path? Perhaps you were a mercenary exposed to primordial influences. Maybe you were a sailor, using wind and water to shorten sea voyages and protect your crew from pirates and raiders. Conversely, you may be an acolyte of pacifism, unleashing your destructive potential when fear overrides your better judgment. The choice is yours, and the elements are your weapons.

### Level 3: Bonus Ferocity Spells

The following spells are added to your bender spell list. They always take the form of an element associated with your Elemental Affinity. For example, a _guardian of faith_ may take the form of a giant stalagmite projecting spears of rock (earth affinity), or a storm cloud letting loose booms of thunder (air affinity). Once you gain access to a discipline spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

|Bender Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|3rd|magic missile*,|
|5th|magic weapon|
|9th|blink**|
|13th|guardian of faith*|
|17th|arcane hand|

*The damage type is one for which you have affinity instead of what is specified (you choose when you cast the spell).
**You move to a Border-Elemental Plane associated with your Elemental Affinity (see page 159).

### Level 3: Martial Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with all martial weapons and can use any weapon you are proficient with as a spellcasting focus for your bender spells.

### Level 3: Elemental Conduit

You have learned to channel elemental energy beyond your fist to the weapons you wield. You can use your bender spellcasting ability instead of Strength or Dexterity for weapon attack and damage rolls.

### Level 7: Destructive Nature

When you hit a creature with an attack, you can expend a spell slot to deal extra damage of a type associated with your Elemental Affinity. The extra damage is 2d8 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d8 for each spell level higher than 1st, to a maximum of 6d8.

### Level 15: Elemental Ferocity

The damage of your Elemental Combo feature increases to 5d4.

### Level 20: Primordial Battery

You can attack three times whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.

## Disciple of Fortification

A bubble of temperate calm amongst a raging wildfire, a wedge of unmoving rock within a landslide, a shield of ice against fist-sized hailstones; you are a **bulwark against the forces of nature**, bending them to protect yourself and your allies. You understand that your role is not to crush and slaughter but to preserve those around you so you may triumph together.
As a **Disciple of Fortification**, you may have taken a vow of pacifism yet still yearn for a life of danger and adventure. Perhaps you worked as a bodyguard, valuing the life of another more than your own. Maybe you found employment in a mine, saving colleagues from death by rock and explosives. Or it could be that your self-preservation instincts are so well honed that you cannot help but avoid catastrophe.
Either way, the **elements shield and fortify you** from hurt and harm.

### Level 3: Bonus Fortification Spells

The following spells are added to your bender spell list. They always take the form of an element associated with your Elemental Affinity. For example, a _shield_ may appear as ice (water affinity) or rock (earth affinity). Once you gain access to a discipline spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

|Bender Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|3rd|shield|
|5th|shielding word*|
|9th|protection from energy**|
|13th|resilient sphere|
|17th|endure*|

*See Chapter 13 - Spells
**Must be a damage type for which you have affinity (see Elemental Affinity, page 159)

### Level 3: Defensive Proficiencies

You gain proficiency with heavy armour and shields. In addition, you can use a shield as a spellcasting focus for your bender spells.

### Level 3: Primordial Shield

You learn to create a shield of primordial energy. As a bonus action on your turn, you can create this shield, granting you or a willing creature within 30 feet of you 1d6 temporary hit points. These temporary hit points last until you use this feature again or the target finishes a long rest.
The number of temporary hit points increases to 1d10 at 6th level, 2d6 at 10th level, and 2d10 at 14th level.

### Level 7: Redirect Elements

When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you (including yourself) would take damage of a type associated with your Elemental Affinity (see page 159), you can use your reaction to reduce that damage. The damage is reduced by 2d6 for each time you have chosen affinity with that element. If this reduces the damage to 0, you can make a ranged spell attack, redirecting the energy at a target within 30 feet of the original target. The attack deals damage equal to the amount by which you reduced the triggering damage.
The size of these dice increase to d8s at 11th level, d10s at 15th level, and d12s at 20th level.

### Level 15: Elemental Reinforcement

When you cast a bender spell of 1st level or higher, you can choose one creature you can see within 30 feet of you (including yourself) to gain a bonus to AC equal to the base level of the spell until the start of your next turn.

### Level 20: Primordial Bulwark

When you roll initiative and aren’t surprised, you can use your reaction to cast a spell associated with your Elemental Affinity, as shown in the table below, without expending a spell slot. Once you use this feature, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.

|Elemental Affinity Spell|Spells|
|---|---|
|Air|wind wall|
|Earth|wall of stone|
|Fire|wall of fire|
|Water|white water wall*|

## Disciple of Fusion

The elements are pure: **solid earth, liquid water, gaseous air, and fire—energy incarnate.** However, the borders between these elements are where things get interesting. Water and earth can produce calamitous mudslides capable of decimating an army. When wind whips up sand, a dust storm can leave even the hardiest explorers lost and disoriented. And in the quiet of a bathhouse, the confluence of fire and water can bring about calming steam that cleanses the body and soothes the soul.
A bender of the **Disciple of Fusion** lives on these elemental extremities, pushing the borders, always with an eye on the primordial forces that they have not yet mastered. Your connection to every element runs so deeply that it is almost second nature to blend them together. You may smelt ore with astounding alacrity, be a sculptor whose ability to shape ice rivals that of the finest enkoh architects, or perhaps you work as a thief, creating clouds of smoke to blind guards and make good your escape.
**You are the unexpected solution that changes the paradigm of any problem.**

### Level 3: Bonus Cantrips

Your connection with all elements allows you to mould them in their most basic form. You learn two additional bender cantrips of your choice, which can be from any element’s list, and don’t count towards the number of cantrips you know.

### Level 3: Bonus Spells

As your connection with the primordial forces deepens, you learn to manipulate even the elements with which you are less familiar. You learn one 1st-level bender spell from any element’s list; you always have that spell prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. When you reach 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level in this class, you learn one 2nd-, 3rd-, 4th-, and 5th-level bender spell in this way, respectively. If you don’t have affinity with the element from which a spell is chosen, the spell is cast as if you had 1 affinity with that element.

### Level 3: Fusionist Spellcasting

When you expend a spell slot of 1st level or higher to cast a spell from your bender spell repertoire, you can augment it with another element, creating an additional effect in a sphere centered on the target of your spell or, if the spell affects an area, the center of the affected area.
You choose the size of the sphere, which can have a maximum radius in feet equal to five times the level of the spell slot expended. The effect depends on the element list from which the spell was drawn, and the element with which you choose to combine it.
Any saving throws are against your bender spell save DC. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once), and regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.

|Combination|Effect|
|---|---|
|Air & Earth: Dust|Dust explodes in the sphere. Each creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of your next turn.|
|Air & Fire: Smoke|Cloying smoke fills the sphere. Area is heavily obscured, creatures speak falteringly, and creatures casting spells with verbal components must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or waste the spellcasting action.|
|Air & Water: Ice|Slick ice covers surfaces, turning the area into difficult terrain. Creatures in the area must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. Creatures entering or ending their turn there must also succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.|
|Earth & Fire: Lava|Molten rock explodes in the sphere. Creatures must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take 1d6 fire damage per spell level expended.|
|Earth & Water: Mud|Sticky mud erupts, turning the area into difficult terrain. Speed is reduced by 15 feet, and creatures can use an action to clean mud off themselves or others to remove the speed reduction.|
|Fire & Water: Steam|Steam fills the sphere. Area is heavily obscured, and creatures that end their turn in the sphere take 1d4 fire damage per spell level expended.|

### Level 7: Interelemental Casting

When you cast a spell which deals damage of a type associated with an Elemental Affinity, you can change the damage type to one associated with one of your Elemental Affinities.
In addition, when a creature you can see casts a spell that deals damage of a type associated with any Elemental Affinity, you can use your reaction to make a spellcasting ability check. The DC for the check equals 10 plus the spell’s level (cantrips are DC 10). On a success, you change the damage type to one associated with one of your Elemental Affinities.

### Level 15: Unleashed Elements

On your turn, when you use your action to cast a bender spell of 1st level or higher, you can cast a bender cantrip with a casting time of one action as a bonus action that turn.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once) and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Level 20: Avatar of Elements

You gain two additional Elemental Affinities of your choice, for a total of six affinities. You can have no more than four affinities for any one element.

## Disciple of Invigoration

A rock suddenly lowers, dropping an ally a crucial inch and turning a critical hit into a glancing blow. A precise gust of wind accelerates an arrow over a foe’s shield, striking them in the eye. A burst of flame temporarily blinds an opponent, causing their battleaxe to swing wide.
Where others shield and strike, Disciples of Invigoration prefer a more subtle approach, bolstering an ally from within or manipulating a foe’s attacks with alacritous and shrewd bursts of elemental energy.
Why did you choose this path? Did you always have a helpful disposition? Were you an aide de camp in a large army? A wizard’s apprentice that wandered into an elemental experiment? Whatever your choice, you are the favourable wind that stops a friend falling, the slick rock that foils a foe’s footing, and the inner flame that turns the tide of battle.

### Level 3: Bonus Invigoration Spells

The following spells are added to your bender spell list. They always take the form of an element associated with your Elemental Affinity. For example, the _bless_ spell may manifest as fortuitous gusts of wind (air affinity) or illuminating sparks (fire affinity).
Once you gain access to a discipline spell, you always have it prepared, and it doesn’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.

|Bender Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|3rd|bless|
|5th|enhance ability|
|9th|haste|
|13th|freedom of movement|
|17th|greater restoration|

### Level 3: Inner Vigor

Your connection to the elements invigorates your body. Your hit point maximum increases by 3 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.
In addition, you can add your bender spellcasting ability modifier to checks you make to maintain your concentration.

### Level 3: Primordial Pulse

With shrewd timing, you imbue an ally with invigorating energy. When a willing creature you can see within 30 feet of you fails a saving throw or misses an attack roll, you can use your reaction to give it a rejuvenating boost. It immediately rerolls the saving throw or attack roll, with an additional bonus equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier, and it must use the new result, potentially turning a failed save into a success or a missed attack into a hit.
If this rerolled attack hits, it deals extra damage of a type associated with one of your Elemental Affinities (your choice when you take the reaction) equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Level 7: Distracting Onslaught

Once on your turn, when you deal damage to a creature using a damage type associated with your Elemental Affinity, you can cause the elements to manifest in a distracting array: fire may burst into dazzling lights, water may foam into obscuring spray, and wind or earth may whip up into a cloud. The next time the target makes an attack roll or saving throw before the end of its next turn, it must roll a d8 and subtract that from the result.
You can use this feature a number of times equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Level 15: Elemental Enhancement

Once per turn when you cast a bender spell of 1st level or higher that targets an ally, you can enhance that spell (no action required). Choose one of the following options:
- You end one of the following conditions on the creature (your choice): blinded, charmed, deafened, frightened, poisoned, or stunned.
- The creature can add a d6 to the next attack roll or saving throw it makes before the end of its next turn.
- The creature can use its reaction to make one weapon attack.
- The creature can use its reaction to move up to half its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.
If the spell targets more than one ally, you choose which ally gains the benefit. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your bender spellcasting ability modifier (minimum of once) and regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Level 20: Primordial Invigoration

When you enter your Primordial Avatar state, you can grant up to five willing creatures within 30 feet of you one level 1 benefit listed in an appropriate Primordial Avatar Benefits table for an element with which you have affinity. You choose a single effect to grant to all the creatures, which lasts until your Primordial Avatar state ends.

# Multiclass
