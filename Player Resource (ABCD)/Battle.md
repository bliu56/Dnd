# Initiative

Depending on the encounter, there will groups that players will be slotted into depending on their initiative rolls.

Groups will always be [Player] [Enemy] [Player]

For multiple enemies, they will be grouped depending on their dex scores. For example, a goblins and a dragon would result in the following:
[==Group 1 Players==] [==Dragon Dex: 18==] [==Group 2 Players==] [==Goblin Dex: 12]== [==Group 3 Players==]

If players roll higher than 18 → Group 1
If between 18 and 12 → Group 2
If lower than 12 → Group 3

To move Groups, take the [[dnd/Player Resource (ABCD)/Battle|Battle]].

## Critical Miss (Nat 1)

When you critically hit, the opponent chooses one of the following effect:
- Free Attack
- Generate 2 stacks of Momentum
- [More to be Unlocked Later]

# Momentum

You can gain and lose stacks of momentum throughout battle. Battles are on even footing until one side gains an advantage over the other, often leading to a decision blow or multiple attacks on the enemy without them being able to respond.

Momentum will go back and forth. It can be either Neutral, Positive (Favoring players), or Negative (Favoring enemies).

Momentum can be spent by either side once it has crossed a certain threshold. Once spent, the side that cashed it in will gain an additional action to do. If that action is a basic attack, the victim can roll a D20 [DC 15] to negate the attack and end Momentum. Every fail will reduce the DC by 2.

This will be secretly tracked by the DM.
