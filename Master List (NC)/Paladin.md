# Summary
---
Paladins are united by their oaths to stand against the forces of annihilation and corruption. Whether sworn before a god's altar, in a sacred glade before nature spirits or in a moment of desperation and grief with the dead as the only witness, a Paladin's oath is a powerful bond. It is a source of power that turns a devout warrior into a blessed champion.
Paladins train to learn the skills of combat, mastering a variety of weapons and armor. Even so, their martial skills are secondary to the magical power they wield: power to heal the injured, smite their foes, and protect the helpless and those who fight at their side.
Almost by definition, the life of a Paladin is an adventuring life, for every Paladin lives on the lines of the cosmic struggle against annihilation. Fighters are rare enough among the ranks of the world's armies, but even fewer can claim the calling of a Paladin. When they do receive the call, these blessed folk turn from their former occupations and take up arms and magic.

# Levels
---
## Level 1
### Lay On Hands
Your blessed touch can heal wounds. You have a pool of healing power that replenishes when you finish a Long Rest. With that pool, you can restore a total number of Hit Points equal to five times your Paladin level.
As a Bonus Action, you can touch a creature (which could be yourself) and draw power from the pool of healing to restore a number of Hit Points to that creature, up to the maximum amount remaining in the pool.
You can also expend 5 Hit Points from the pool of healing power to remove the Poisoned condition from the creature; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.
### Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Longswords and Javelins.
Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change the kinds of weapons you chose. For Example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Halberds and Flails.
### Spellcasting
You have learned to cast spells through prayer and meditation. See chapter 7 for the rules on spellcasting. The Information below details how you use those rules with Paladin spells, which appear in the Paladin spell list later in the class's description.
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Spell Slots|The Paladin Features table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your level 1+ spells. You regain all expended slots when you finish a Long Rest.|
|Prepared Spells of Level 1+|You prepare the list of level 1+ spells that are available for you to cast with this feature. To start, choose two level 1 Paladin spells Heroism and Searing Smite are recommended.  <br>  <br>The number of spells on your list increases as you gain Paladin levels, as shown in the Prepared Spells column of the Paladin Features table. Whenever that number increases, choose additional spells from the Paladin spell list until the number of spells on your list matches the number on the table. The chosen spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For example, if you're a level 5 Paladin, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of levels 1 and 2 in any combination.  <br>  <br>If another Paladin feature gives you spells that you always have prepared, those spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare with this feature, but those spells otherwise count as Paladin spells for you.|
|Changing Your Prepared Spells|Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can change your list of prepared spells, replacing any of the spells there with other Paladin spells for which you have spell slots.|
|Spellcasting Ability|Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your Paladin spells.|
|Spellcasting Focus|You can use a Holy Symbol as a Spellcasting Focus for your Paladin spells.|
## Level 2
### Fighting Style
You gain a [[dnd/Master List (NC)/Feats]] of your choice (see chapter 5). Instead of choosing one of those feats, you can choose the option below.
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Blessed Warrior|You learn two Cleric cantrips of your choice (See the Cleric class's section for a list of Cleric spells). Guidance and Sacred Flame are recommended. The chosen cantrips count as Paladin spells for you, and Charisma is your spellcasting ability for them. Whenever you gain a Paladin level, you can replace one of these cantrips with another Cleric cantrip.|
### Paladin's Smite
You always have the [Divine Smite](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:divine-smite) spell prepared.
You can cast it without expending a spell slot, but you must finish a Short Rest before you can cast it this way again.
## Level 3
### Channel Divinity
You can channel divine energy directly from the Outer Planes, using it to fuel magical effects. You start with one such effect: Divine Sense, which is described below. Other Paladin features give additional Channel Divinity effect options. Each time you use this class's Channel Divinity, you choose which effect from this class to create.
You can use this class's Channel Divinity twice. You regain one of its expended uses when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. You gain an additional use when you reach Paladin level 11.
If a Channel Divinity effect requires a saving throw, the DC equals the spell save DC from this class's Spellcasting Feature.
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Divine Sense|As a Bonus Action, you can open your awareness to detect Celestials, Fiends, and Undead. For the next 10 minutes or until you have the Incapacitated condition, you know the location of any creature of those types within 60 feet of yourself, and you know its creature type. Within the same radius, you also detect the presence of any place or object that has been consecrated or desecrated, as with the Hallow spell.|
### Breaking Your Oath
A Paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most dedicated are fallible. Sometimes a Paladin transgresses on their oath.
A Paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution, spending an all-night vigil as a sign of penitence or undertaking a fast. After a rite of forgiveness, the Paladin starts fresh.
If your Paladin unrepentantly violates their oath, talk to your DM. Your Paladin should probably take a more appropriate subclass or even abandon the class and adopt another one.
### Subclass
You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. [[dnd/Master List (NC)/Paladin]]
## Level 4
You gain the [[dnd/Master List (NC)/Feats]] or another [[dnd/Master List (NC)/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.
### Slow Fall
You can take a Reaction when you fall to reduce any damage you take from the fall by an amount equal to five times your Monk level.
## Level 5
### Extra Attack

### Faithful Steed

You always have the [Find Steed](http://dnd2024.wikidot.com/spell:find-steed) spell prepared.
You can also cast the spell once without expending a spell slot, and you regain your ability to do so when you finish a Long Rest.
## Level 6
### Aura of Protection
You radiate a protective, unseeable aura in a 10-foot Emanation that originates from you. The aura is inactive while you have the Incapacitated condition.
You and your allies in the aura gain a bonus to saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum bonus of +1).
If another Paladin is present, a creature can benefit from only one Aura of Protection at a time; the creature chooses which aura while in them.
## Level 7
### Extra Attack
Your zealous righteousness can inspire or demoralize others. When you take the Attack action and hit with two attacks, you can use a bonus action to utter a battlecry, targeting one enemy or ally within 30 feet of you. If the target is a foe that can see or hear you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier) or be frightened of you until the end of your next turn. If the target is an ally, the frightened condition ends on it. You can use this feature once per turn.
## Level 8
You gain the [[dnd/Master List (NC)/Feats]] or another [[dnd/Master List (NC)/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.
## Level 9
### Abjure Foes
As a Magic action, you can expend one use of this class's Channel Divinity to overwhelm foes with awe. As you present your Holy Symbol or weapon, you can target a number of creatures equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature) that you can see within 60 feet of yourself. Each target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or have the Frightened condition for 1 minute or until it takes any damage. While Frightened in this way, a target can only do one of the following on its turns: move, take an action or take a Bonus Action.
## Level 10
### Aura of Courage
You and your allies have Immunity to the Frightened condition while in your Aura of Protection. If a Frightened ally enters the aura, that condition has no effect on that ally while there.
## Level 11
### Radiant Strikes
Your strikes now carry supernatural power. When you hit a target with an attack roll using a Melee weapon or an Unarmed Strike, the target takes an extra 1d8 Radiant damage.
## Level 12
You gain the [[dnd/Master List (NC)/Feats]] or another [[dnd/Master List (NC)/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.
## Level 13
### Deflect Energy
You can now use your Deflect Attacks feature against attacks that deal any damage type, not just Bludgeoning, Piercing, or Slashing.
## Level 14
### Restoring Touch
When you use Lay On Hands on a creature, you can also remove one or more of the following conditions from the creature: Blinded, Charmed, Deafened, Frightened, Paralyzed, or Stunned. You must expend 5 Hit Points from the healing pool of Lay On Hands for each of these conditions you remove; those points don't also restore Hit Points to the creature.
## Level 15
## Level 16
You gain the [[dnd/Master List (NC)/Feats]] or another [[dnd/Master List (NC)/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.

_Uphold the Ideals of Justice and Order_
The Oath of Devotion binds Paladins to the ideals of Justice and Order. These Paladins meet the archetype of the knight in shining armor. They hold themselves to the highest standards of conduct, and some - for better or worse - hold the rest of the world to the same standards.
Many who swear this oath are devoted to gods of law and good and use their gods' tenets as the measure of personal devotion. Others holed angels as their ideals and incorporate images of angelic wings into their helmets or coats of arms.

The weapon also emits Bright Light in a 20-foot radius and Dim Light 20 feet beyond that.
You can end this effect early (no action required). This effect also ends if you aren't carrying the weapon.

### Level 15: Glorious Defense
You can turn defense into a sudden strike. When you or another creature you can see within 10 feet of you is hit by an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to grant a bonus to the target's AC against that attack, potentially causing it to miss.

## Oath of the Ancients
_Preserve Life and Light in the World_
The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the first elves.
Paladins who swear this oath cherish the light; they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world more than any principles of honor, courage and justice. They often adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things - leaves, antlers, or flowers - to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light.
These Paladins share the following tenets:
- Kindle the light of hope.
- Shelter life.
- Delight in art and laughter.
### Level 3: Nature's Wrath

### Level 15: Undying Sentinel
When you are reduced to 0 Hit Points and not killed outright, you can drop to 1 Hit Point instead, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to three times your Paladin level. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
Additionally, you can't be aged magically, and you cease visibly aging.
### Level 20: Elder Champion
As a Bonus Action, you can imbue your Aura of Protection with primal power, granting the benefits below for 1 minute or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).
|   |   |

|Regeneration|At the start of each of your turns, you regain 10 Hit Points.|
|Swift Spells|Whenever you cast a spell that has a casting time of an action, you can cast it using a Bonus Action instead.|
## Oath of the Vengeance
_Preserve Life and Light in the World_
_Punish Evildoers at Any Cost_
The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed grievously evil acts. When evil armies slaughter helpless villagers, when a tyrant defies the will of the gods, when a thieves' guild grows too violent, when a dragon rampages though the countryside - at times like these, Paladins arise and swear the Oath of Vengeance to set right what has gone wrong.
These Paladins share the following tenets:
- Show the wicked no mercy.
- Fight injustice and its causes.
- Aid those harmed by injustice.
### Level 3: Vow of Enmity
When you take the Attack action, you can expend one use of your Channel Divinity to utter a vow of enmity against a creature you can see within 30 feet of yourself. You have Advantage on attack rolls against the creature for 1 minute or until you use this feature again.
If the creature drops to 0 Hit Points before the vow ends, you can transfer the vow to a different creature within 30 feet of yourself (no action required).
### Level 3: Oath of Vengeance Spells
The magic of your oath ensures you always have certain spells ready; when you reach a Paladin level specified in the Oath of Vengeance Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.
### **Oath of Ancients Spells**
|Paladin Level|Spells|
|---|---|
|3|Bane, Hunter's Mark|
|5|Hold Person, Misty Step|
|9|Haste, Protection from Energy|
|13|Banishment, Dimension Door|
|17|Hold Monster, Scrying|
### Level 7: Relentless Avenger
Your supernatural focus helps you close off a foe's retreat. When you hit a creature with an Opportunity Attack, you can reduce the creature's Speed to 0 until the end of the current turn. You can then move up to half your Speed as part of the same Reaction. This movement doesn't provoke Opportunity Attacks.
### Level 15: Soul of Vengeance
Immediately after a creature under the effect of your Vow of Enmity hits or misses with an attack roll, you can take a Reaction to make a melee attack against that creature if it's within range.
### Level 20: Avenging Angel
As a Bonus Action, you gain the benefits below for 10 minutes or until you end them (no action required). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest. You can also restore your use of it by expending a level 5 spell slot (no action required).

|---|---|
|Diminish Defiance|You sprout spectral wings on your back and have a Fly Speed of 60 feet, and can hover.|
