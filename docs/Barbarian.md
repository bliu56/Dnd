# Summary
---
Barbarians are mighty warriors who are powered by primal forces of the multiverse that manifest as a Rage. More than a mere emotion—and not limited to anger—this Rage is an incarnation of a predator’s ferocity, a storm's fury, and a sea's turmoil.
Some Barbarians personify their Rage as a fierce spirit or revered forebear. Others see it as a connection to the pain and anguish of the world, as an impersonal tangle of wild magic, or as an expression of their own deepest self. For every Barbarian, their Rage is a power that fuels not just battle prowess, but also uncanny reflexes and heightened senses.
Barbarians often serve as protectors and leaders in their communities. They charge headlong into danger so those under their protection don't have to. Their courage in the face of danger makes Barbarians perfectly suited for adventure.

# Levels
---
## Level 1
### RAGE
You can imbue yourself with a primal power called Rage, a force that grants you extraordinary might and resilience. You can enter it as a Bonus Action if you aren't wearing Heavy armor.
You can enter your Rage the number of times shown for your Barbarian level in the Rages column of the Barbarian Features table. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.
While active, your Rage follows the rules below.
|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Damage Resistance**|You have Resistance to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Slashing damage.|
|**Rage Damage**|When you make an attack using Strength—with either a weapon or an Unarmed Strike—and deal damage to the target, you gain a bonus to the damage that increases as you gain levels as a Barbarian, as shown in the Rage Damage column of the Barbarian Features table.|
|**Strength Advantage**|You have Advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.|
|**No Concentration or Spells**|You can't maintain Concentration, and you can't cast spells|
|**Duration**|The Rage lasts until the end of your next turn, and it ends early if you don Heavy armor or have the Incapacitated condition. If your Rage is still active on your next turn, you can extend the Rage for another round by doing one of the following:  <br>  <br>• Make an attack roll against an enemy.  <br>• Force an enemy to make a saving throw.  <br>• Take a Bonus Action to extend your Rage.  <br>  <br>Each time the Rage is extended, it lasts until the end of your next turn. You can maintain a Rage for up to 10 minutes.|
### Unarmored Defense
While you aren't wearing any armor, your base Armor Class equals 10 plus your Dexterity and Constitution modifiers. You can use a Shield and still gain this benefit.
### Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the ==[[dnd/docs/Weapons Glossary]]== of two kinds of Simple or Martial Melee weapons of your choice, such as Greataxes and Handaxes. Whenever you finish a Long Rest, you can practice weapon drills and change one of those weapon choices.
When you reach certain Barbarian levels, you gain the ability to use the mastery properties of more kinds of weapons, as shown in the Weapon Mastery column of the Barbarian Features table.
## Level 2
### Danger Sense
You gain an uncanny sense of when things aren't as they should be, giving you an edge when you dodge perils. You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws unless you have the Incapacitated condition.
### Reckless Attack
You can throw aside all concern for defense to attack with increased ferocity. When you make your first attack roll on your turn, you can decide to attack recklessly. Doing so gives you Advantage on attack rolls using Strength until the start of your next turn, but attack rolls against you have Advantage during that time.
## Level 3
### Subclass
You gain a Barbarian subclass of your choice. [[dnd/docs/Barbarian|Barbarian]]
### Primal Knowledge
You gain proficiency in another skill of your choice from the skill list available to Barbarians at level 1.
In addition, while your Rage is active, you can channel primal power when you attempt certain tasks; whenever you make an ability check using one of the following skills, you can make it as a Strength check even if it normally uses a different ability: Acrobatics, Intimidation, Perception, Stealth, or Survival. When you use this ability, your Strength represents primal power coursing through you, honing your agility, bearing, and senses.
## Level 4
You gain the [[dnd/docs/Feats]] or another [[dnd/docs/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.
## Level 5
### Extra Attack
You can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the Attack action on your turn.
### Fast Movement
Your speed increases by 10 feet while you aren't wearing Heavy armor.
## Level 6
Check Subclass
## Level 7
### Feral Instinct
Your instincts are so honed that you have Advantage on Initiative rolls.
### Instinctive Pounce
As part of the Bonus Action you take to enter your Rage, you can move up to half your Speed.
### Extra Attack
The fury of your attacks can knock a foe to the ground. When you take the Attack action and make an attack roll against a creature with advantage, if both of the d20 rolls would hit the target, you can force the target to make a Strength saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your attacking ability modifier). On a failure, you can choose to knock the target prone or push it up to 5 feet away from you. Creatures more than one size larger than you automatically succeed on this saving throw. You can use this feature once per turn.
## Level 8
You gain the [[dnd/docs/Feats]] or another [[dnd/docs/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.
## Level 9
### Brutal Strike
If you use Reckless Attack, you can forgo any Advantage on one Strength-based attack roll of your choice on your turn. The chosen attack roll mustn't have Disadvantage. If the chosen attack roll hits, the target takes an extra 1d10 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon or Unarmed Strike, and you can cause one Brutal Strike effect of your choice.
You have the following effect options.
|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Forceful Blow**|The target is pushed 15 feet straight away from you. You can then move up to half your Speed straight toward the target without provoking Opportunity Attacks.|
|**Hamstring Blow**|The target’s Speed is reduced by 15 feet until the start of your next turn. A target can be affected by only one Hamstring Blow at a time— the most recent one.|
## Level 10
Check Subclass
## Level 11
### Relentless Rage
Your Rage can keep you fighting despite grievous wounds. If you drop to 0 Hit Points while your Rage is active and don't die outright, you can make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. If you succeed, your Hit Points instead change to a number equal to twice your Barbarian level.
Each time you use this feature after the first, the DC increases by 5. When you finish a Short or Long Rest, the DC resets to 10.
## Level 12
You gain the [[dnd/docs/Feats]] or another [[dnd/docs/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.
## Level 13
### Improved Brutal Strike
You have honed new ways to attack furiously. The following effects are now among your Brutal Strike options.
|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Staggering Blow**|The target has Disadvantage on the next saving throw it makes, and it can’t make Opportunity Attacks until the start of your next turn.|
|**Sundering Blow**|Before the start of your next turn, the next attack roll made by another creature against the target gains a +5 bonus to the roll. An attack roll can gain only one Sundering Blow bonus.|
## Level 14
Check Subclass
## Level 15
### Persistent Rage
When you roll Initiative, you can regain all expended uses of Rage. After you regain uses of Rage in this way, you can’t do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
In addition, your Rage is so fierce that it now lasts for 10 minutes without you needing to do anything to extend it from round to round. Your Rage ends early if you have the Unconscious condition (not just the Incapacitated condition) or don Heavy armor.
## Level 16
You gain the [[dnd/docs/Feats]] or another [[dnd/docs/Feats]]of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Barbarian levels 8, 12, and 16.
## Level 17
### Improved Brutal Strike
The extra damage of your Brutal Strike increases to 2d10. In addition, you can use two different Brutal Strike effects whenever you use your Brutal Strike feature.
## Level 18
### Indomitable Might
If your total for a Strength check or Strength saving throw is less than your Strength score, you can use that score in place of the total.
## Level 19
### Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Irresistible Offense is recommended.
## Level 20
### Primal Champion
You embody primal power. Your Strength and Constitution scores increase by 4, to a maximum of 25.

## Path Of The Berserker
_Channel Rage into Violent Fury_
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Berserker direct their Rage primarily toward violence. Their path is one of untrammeled fury, and they thrill in the chaos of battle as they allow their Rage to seize and empower them.
### Level 3: Frenzy
If you use Reckless Attack while your Rage is active, you deal extra damage to the first target you hit on your turn with a Strength-based attack. To determine the extra damage, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. The damage has the same type as the weapon or Unarmed Strike used for the attack.
### Level 6: Mindless Rage
You have Immunity to the Charmed and Frightened conditions while your Rage is active. If you're Charmed or Frightened when you enter your Rage, the condition ends on you.
### Level 10: Retaliation
When you take damage from a creature that is within 5 feet of you, you can take a Reaction to make one melee attack against that creature, using a weapon or an Unarmed Strike.
### Level 14: Intimidating Presence
As a Bonus Action, you can strike terror into others with your menacing presence and primal power. When you do so, each creature of your choice in a 30-foot Emanation originating from you must make a Wisdom saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus). On a failed save, a creature has the Frightened condition for 1 minute. At the end of each of the Frightened creature's turns, the creature repeats the save, ending the effect on itself on a success.
Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use of it.
## Path Of The Wild Heart
_Walk in Communiiy with the Animal World_
Barbarians who follow the Path of the Wild Heart view themselves as kin to animals. These Barbarians learn magical means to communicate with animals, and their Rage heightens their connection to animals as it fills them with supernatural might.

## Path Of The World Tree
_Trace the Roots and Branches of the Multiverse_
Barbarians who follow the Path of the World Tree connect with the cosmic tree Yggdrasil through their Rage. This tree grows among the Outer Planes, connecting them to each other and the Material Plane. These Barbarians draw on the tree’s magic for vitality and as a means of dimensional travel.

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Vitality Surge|When you activate your Rage, you gain a number of Temporary Hit Points equal to your Barbarian level.|
|Life-Giving Force|At the start of each of your turns while your Rage is active, you can choose another creature within 10 feet of yourself to gain Temporary Hit Points. To determine the number of Temporary Hit Points, roll a number of d6s equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and add them together. If any of these Temporary Hit Points remain when your Rage ends, they vanish.|
### Level 6: Branches of the Tree
Whenever a creature you can see starts its turn within 30 feet of you while your Rage is active, you can take a Reaction to summon spectral branches of the World Tree around it. The target must succeed on a Strength saving throw (DC 8 plus your Strength modifier and Proficiency Bonus) or be teleported to an unoccupied space you can see within 5 feet of yourself or in the nearest unoccupied space you can see. After the target teleports, you can reduce its Speed to 0 until the end of the current turn.
### Level 10: Battering Roots
During your turn, your reach is 10 feet greater with any Melee weapon that has the Heavy or Versatile property, as tendrils of the World Tree extend from you. When you hit with such a weapon on your turn, you can activate the Push or Topple mastery property in addition to a different mastery property you're using with that weapon.
### Level 14: Travel along the Tree
When you activate your Rage and as a Bonus Action while your Rage is active, you can teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see. In addition, once per Rage, you can increase the range of that teleport to 150 feet. When you do so, you can also bring up to six willing creatures who are within 10 feet of you. Each creature teleports to an unoccupied space of your choice within 10 feet of your destination space.
## Path Of The Zealot
_Rage in Ecstatic Union with a God_
Barbarians who walk the Path of the Zealot receive boons from a god or pantheon. These Barbarians experience their Rage as an ecstatic episode of divine union that infuses them with power. They are often allies to the priests and other followers of their god or pantheon.
### Level 3: Divine Fury
You can channel divine power into your strikes. On each of your turns while your Rage is active, the first creature you hit with a weapon or an Unarmed Strike takes extra damage equal to 1d6 plus half your Barbarian level (round down). The extra damage is Necrotic or Radiant; you choose the type each time you deal the damage.
### Level 3: Warrior of the Gods
A divine entity helps ensure you can continue the fight. You have a pool of four d12s that you can spend to heal yourself. As a Bonus Action, you can expend dice from the pool, roll them, and regain a number of Hit Points equal to the roll’s total.
Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a Long Rest.
The pool's maximum number of dice increases by one when you reach Barbarian levels 6 (5 dice), 12 (6 dice), and 17 (7 dice).
### Level 6: Fanatical Focus
Once per active Rage, if you fail a saving throw, you can reroll it with a bonus equal to your Rage Damage bonus, and you must use the new roll.
### Level 10: Zealous Presence
As a Bonus Action, you unleash a battle cry infused with divine energy. Up to ten other creatures of your choice within 60 feet of you gain Advantage on attack rolls and saving throws until the start of your next turn.
Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a Long Rest unless you expend a use of your Rage (no action required) to restore your use of it.
### Level 14: Rage of the Gods
When you activate your Rage, you can assume the form of a divine warrior. This form lasts for 1 minute or until you drop to 0 Hit Points. Once you use this feature, you can't do so again until you finish a Long Rest.
While in this form, you gain the benefits below.
|   |   |
|---|---|
|Flight|You have a Fly Speed equal to your Speed and can hover.|
|Resistance|You have Resistance to Necrotic, Psychic, and Radiant damage.|
|Revivification|When a creature within 30 feet of you would drop to 0 Hit Points, you can take a Reaction to expend a use of your Rage to instead change the target’s Hit Points to a number equal to your Barbarian level.|
## Path of the Kaiju
The Path of the Kaiju is one of sheer destructive force. Some warriors of this kind are fueled by a relentless hatred of a kaiju, perhaps one that destroyed their home or ravaged their continent. In such cases, an individual’s burning obsession is a source of incredible strength, manifesting as an aspect of the kaiju’s own power in moments of blind rage. Other barbarians might worship kaiju for their strength and grandeur, calling on their aid in battle, embodying the might and fury of a colossus as they charge into the fray.
### Level 3: Aspect of the Kaiju
When you adopt this path, choose a kaiju through which  
you draw power and gain the associated benefit from the  
options below.
|   |   |
|---|---|
|The Ascendant Dragon|While raging, you can use an action to let loose a devastating blast of radiant energy from your mouth. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Strength modifier + your proficiency bonus), taking 2d10 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Taking this action counts as making an attack for the purpose of maintaining your rage. The damage of this feature increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (3d10), 11th level (4d10), and 17th level (5d10).|
|The Eternal Leviathan|When you enter your rage, or as a bonus action while raging, you can bellow an echoing cry. Each creature of your choice within 10 feet of you must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or have disadvantage on attack rolls against any target other than you until the start of your next turn.|
|The Titan Earth|You can use your Constitution modifier in place of your Strength modifier for Strength checks, as well as for the attack and damage rolls of your unarmed strikes and weapon attacks. These checks and attacks are still considered Strength-based for the purposes of your other features. In addition, you gain tremorsense out to 10 feet.|
|The Armoured Kabuto|While raging, if you move at least 15 feet straight towards a target and then immediately hit it with a weapon attack, the target takes an extra 2d8 bludgeoning damage from the attack.|
|The Infinite Tempest|The first time each turn while raging that you hit a target with a melee attack roll, you deal 1d6 lightning damage to each creature of your choice within 5 feet of the target as lightning spirals out from the point of impact.|
You can switch your chosen kaiju each time you gain a  
new barbarian level.
### Level 3: Apex Hunter
You gain proficiency in the Medicine and Survival skills. If you already have this proficiency, you gain proficiency in another skill of your choice. Additionally, you can take the Brace action*, stand up from prone, or mount a creature using only 5 feet of movement.
### Level 6: Kaiju Force
When you enter your rage, you can increase your size and the size of your equipment. If you are smaller than Large, you become Large, and any objects you are wearing or carrying increase by the same relative amount; your weight increases by a factor of 8 for each size category increased. If you lack the room to become Large, you grow to the maximum attainable size. This growth lasts until your rage ends. Objects enlarged by this feature that are no longer in contact with you at the end of a turn return to the size they were before this feature affected them. While in this form, you can add your Constitution modifier to all Strength checks and Strength saving throws, and your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage on a hit.
### Level 10: Transformation of the Kaiju
You gain the power to transform into a vassal of a kaiju when you rage. This kaiju can be the same as your Aspect of the Kaiju feature, or a different one.
|   |   |
|---|---|
|The Ascendant Dragon|While raging, you and any objects you are wearing or carrying assume a pseudo-liquid form. In this form, you have resistance to fire damage, you are immune to the grappled and restrained conditions, you gain a swimming speed of 60 feet, you can move through other creatures’ spaces and through gaps as small as 1 inch wide without squeezing (but you can’t stop there), and you gain the benefits of half cover while submerged in water.|
|The Eternal Leviathan|While raging, you adopt a translucent, ghastly form. In this form, you have resistance to cold and necrotic damage, and you can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. You take 5 force damage if you end your turn inside an object or creature. If you are inside an object or creature when your rage ends, you are shunted to the nearest unoccupied space and take 5 force damage for every 5 feet traveled.|
|The Titan Earth|When you use your Kaiju Force feature, if you are smaller than Huge, you become Huge instead of Large, along with anything you are wearing. In addition to the effects of that feature, your reach increases by 5 feet, and your weapon attacks deal an extra 1d4 damage on a hit (2d4 extra damage total) until your rage ends.|
|The Armoured Kabuto|While raging, you sprout large, insectoid wings. You have a flying speed equal to your walking speed, and opportunity attacks against you have disadvantage.|
|The Infinite Tempest|While raging, you crackle with lightning and your blows land with booming claps of thunder. In this form, you have resistance to lightning and thunder damage, and you can use a bonus action to move in a straight line up to 30 feet, passing through other creatures without provoking opportunity attacks. Each creature you pass through in this way must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus) or take 2d6 lightning damage.|
### Level 14: Rampage
While you are raging and have hit points equal to or less than half your hit point maximum, your speed increases by 10 feet, and you can make one weapon attack as a bonus action. Furthermore, if you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead. You can use this feature to succeed on a saving throw a number of times equal to half your Constitution modifier (minimum of once), and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
